    "wf_content": "<p>Charges against three Southeast subsistence fishermen &mdash; including former Sen. Albert Kookesh &mdash; have once again been dismissed. In an opinion issued Friday, the Alaska Supreme Court found that because the regulation used to cite the men was not created lawfully, it&rsquo;s unenforceable. The decision could have a major impact on Department of Fish and Game bag limits across the state.</p>\r\n<p>Estrada v. the State of Alaska concerned three men accused of taking more fish than their permits allowed.&nbsp;A fourth man, Scott Hunter, eventually pled guilty to an amended charge of fishing without a permit.</p>\r\n<p>Hunter, Rocky Estrada, Stanley Johnson and former Angoon Sen. Albert Kookesh were cited&nbsp;in July 2009 for harvesting 148 fish; their permits only allowed for 15 sockeye salmon harvested per family from Kanalku Bay near Angoon. Kookesh &mdash; who&rsquo;s served in both bodies of Alaska&rsquo;s Legislature and as chairman of Sealaska &mdash; says he wasn&rsquo;t even fishing that day.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When I saw Fish and Game come in and start giving them citations, I was looking for something that would challenge the bag limit,&rdquo; Kookesh said.&nbsp;At the time of the citations, he was representing Senate District C, which included a number of Southeast villages.&nbsp;&ldquo;When I saw them giving my brothers a citation, I went over and said, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s my permit; I want to get a citation, too.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The charges were dismissed by a judge at first, but the state appealed.</p>\r\n<p>The fishermen saw the citations as unfair. Kookesh said no one in Angoon recalled the Department of Fish and Game consulting with locals informally &mdash; which the department claims it did &mdash; let alone officially. If they had, Kookesh says the resulting regulation that set the bag limit may have been more agreeable to locals. He says the department erred in not establishing a definition for &ldquo;family&rdquo; or explaining how they decided on 15 fish.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Less than a mile away from where we got cited, commercial fishermen were fishing, catching all the fish they wanted,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>In 2013, the Alaska Court of Appeals reinstated the charges. Their reasoning was that because the Legislature knew the Board of Fisheries was enacting this kind of regulation, their inaction to amend or clarify the board&rsquo;s power indicated that they believed the board acted within its authority.</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a conclusion the Supreme Court found to be beside the point.</p>\r\n<p>For the justices, the question wasn&rsquo;t about the authority to create regulations; it was about whether those regulations were established according to the Administrative Procedures Act &mdash; a law that defines the process for creating a regulation.</p>\r\n<p>How extensively this decision will affect bag limits across the state is still unknown.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This may not just be for the bag limit in Angoon. There are bag limits for everything in the state &mdash; for moose, for deer, for everything. And we don&rsquo;t think that this is going to be such a small Angoon case; it&rsquo;s going to be an Alaska case,&rdquo; Kookesh said.</p>\r\n<p>Fish and Game Deputy Commissioner Kevin Brooks says the department is also trying to figure out what the decision means for their subsistence management regime.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to pull together our directors on Monday morning and with the Department of Law just walk through it,&rdquo; Brooks said.&nbsp;&ldquo;It has resource management implications and they&rsquo;re pretty varied. It&rsquo;s commercial, sport, subsistence and wildlife. We&rsquo;ve got to spend some time and figure it out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for the governor said the Walker administration is still reviewing the case.</p>\r\n<p>Kookesh says this is just one of many issues surrounding subsistence management in the state that will be challenged over the coming years. He says this case was really about making the department consult with people&nbsp;in rural Alaska.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We intended to fight this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We intended to challenge it and we did. And today after all those years and all that heartache and all that stress, we finally got a result that we think is right.&rdquo;</p>",

The narration stays true to Harold Napoleon&rsquo;s original words.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s verbatim because his writing is so poetic, and so I couldn&rsquo;t do better than that,&rdquo; Hebert said.</p>\r\n<p>The re-enactment conveys what the Yup&rsquo;ik word Yuuyaraq means.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Their spiritual beliefs, the way they viewed the world, everything had a spirit. Everything was in harmony and it was kind of like a code of living,&rdquo; Hebert said.</p>\r\n<p>Napoleon wrote Yuuyaraq in 1988 when he was in prison for the death of his son. He says he was so drunk, he blacked out and doesn&rsquo;t remember it. Without any memory of what happened, he couldn&rsquo;t defend himself and so he pled no contest to second degree murder. He never went to trial and no matter&nbsp;how it happened, he blames himself.</p>\r\n<p>He started writing to figure out why he and so many people he knew struggled with alcohol abuse.</p>\r\n<p>Napoleon is Yup&rsquo;ik Eskimo from Hooper Bay.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I had been baffled for many years about why we knew so very little about our own history and why there was so much shame about our own culture,&rdquo; Napoleon said.</p>\r\n<p>Napoleon is 66. He said he grew up in a very confusing&nbsp;world, being neither fully Yup&rsquo;ik nor white and Christian. There was suffering in the missing pieces of his village&rsquo;s history.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There was also a lot of disconnect between parents and children and that disconnect was not just personal, it was also cultural,&rdquo; Napoleon said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;As children, we were not abandoned literally, but we somehow ended up in nowhere land.&rdquo;<br />Napoleon experienced abuse as a child and drank as an adult. While in prison, he read a lot about trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder in Vietnam War veterans.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Having never been to war and never experienced war or witnessed war, I found it odd that I would have the same symptoms as Vietnam veterans. And not only me but all the other people in my village had the same symptoms,&rdquo; Napoleon said.</p>\r\n<p>After more research, Napoleon learned about the flu epidemic of 1918. In Yuuyaraq, he calls it the &ldquo;Great Death&rdquo; and wrote that it spread like wildfire, killing 6 of every 10 people and wiping out Alaskan villages. &ldquo;It gave birth to a generation of orphans,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>\r\n<p>Up until then, Napoleon said Yup&rsquo;ik people had resisted Christianity and white influence.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But after &lsquo;The Great Death,&rsquo; there was mass conversion and people began to abandon, in a sense, their own culture and in abandoning their culture, they abandoned themselves. There was also born in them a sense of shame and guilt because what they were being taught is that the way they had lived their lives had caused them to die in such great numbers,&rdquo; Napoleon said.</p>\r\n<p>He said&nbsp;the trauma, shame and violence he and others in his village experienced traces back to that time. And it still reverberates today.</p>\r\n<p>Writing Yuuyaraq, Napoleon said, helped him to understand his village and his family, the past and the present.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;With understanding there came forgiveness. I had found a trail of truth through our experiences as Native people,&rdquo; he&nbsp;said.</p>\r\n<p>Napoleon said Alaska Native cultures are going through a reawakening and he hopes Lisle Hebert&rsquo;s film adaptation of Yuuyaraq will contribute to it.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If the young people become interested in their own stories, in their own history, then I think it will have done a good job,&rdquo; Napoleon said.</p>\r\n<p>As a young man, Hebert said he spent time in Hollywood and used to be egotistical about filmmaking, but Yuuyaraq is about something else.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping that people will be moved by it and have more compassion and also realize what (Alaska Natives)&nbsp;have been through, and try to look at people like people,&rdquo; Hebert said.</p>\r\n<p>For Hebert, Yuuyaraq is a meaningful film, and that has given meaning to his own life.</p>",

It&rsquo;s crowded, but up to 50 people have stayed in the house during other wars. This is Haytham&rsquo;s third.</p>\r\n<p>Haytham says they haven&rsquo;t had electricity for more than a week. His family has their own gas-run generator, which they turn on to charge flashlights, laptops and phones. They also use it to pump water to the house.</p>\r\n<p>Without a refrigerator, Haytham&rsquo;s father takes the risk of going to the market a few times a week.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In the U.S. we had fulltime electricity, we have water all the time, we have freedom to go anywhere. But here, I can be scared to go out to get the trash out of the house and I&rsquo;ll be scared if I&rsquo;m going to go to our neighbors&rsquo; to drink some tea or something. It&rsquo;s really hard to get out, even from the house,&rdquo; Haytham says.</p>\r\n<p>The last time Haytham went outside was more than 10 days ago during a ceasefire. It lasted six hours.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I went to hang out with my friends. We tried to go and get a haircut but the places were very crowded so we didn&rsquo;t have a haircut,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n<p>Everyone was in the streets.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;People were happy, you know, just going out from their houses. Not really happy, just relief, you know,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n<p>Haytham says days pass inside the house doing nothing and he loses track of the date. He only sleeps between 5 and 10 a.m. when bombs are less frequent. He says there are more bombs at night.</p>\r\n<p>Inside, Haytham says his family still occasionally laughs.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not the laugh that comes from the heart. We just laugh to let my 6-year-old brother to laugh and feel that he&rsquo;s safe and we&rsquo;re not in danger,&rdquo; he says.<br />Haytham has mixed feelings toward the U.S. due to its relationship with Israel. The U.S. provides Israel with $3 billion in foreign military financing annually, according to the Department of State.</p>\r\n<p>Haytham misses living in Haines, but he says, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really wish to be there right now. My country now needs me. If everyone wishes to be outside, nobody is going to be in Gaza. There should be people staying in Gaza so they can protect it and after the war, they can build it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Haytham is supposed to start his senior year of high school at the end of the month. But, he says, schools have delayed opening. Even if the war ends soon, it&rsquo;ll still take time to repair.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "wf_content": "<p>When you ask anyone to name animals in Alaska, answers run the gamut from wolves to whales and occasionally the erroneous penguin. But there&rsquo;s one animal that hardly ever makes the list: sharks.</p>\r\n<p>The revered&ndash;and often feared&ndash;fish are usually the last thing that comes to mind when you think of Alaska.</p>\r\n<p>But Alaskans need look no further than our own chilly waters to find several species of the formidable fish.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When you hear &lsquo;shark,&rsquo; the general public thinks of something patrolling the surfing beach and you know, sharks are everywhere. To be honest, there are ten foot sharks right outside our door here.&rdquo;<br />Cindy Tribuzio works for NOAA at the Auke Bay lab. She&rsquo;s been researching sharks for more than a decade.</p>\r\n<p>It was originally Alaska&rsquo;s more adored sea creatures that drew Tribuzio to the water.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was going to save the whales for a long time, and then I realized that everyone else was going to save the whales too. And I really wanted to go to grad school and since everybody else was trying to save the whales in grad school, I started volunteering at the Seattle aquarium while I was waiting to get into school, still trying to save the whales, and I started working in their Puget Sound fish section and I realized there&rsquo;s some really cool other things that happen out there.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>She says Alaska is home to three main species of shark including the Spiny Dogfish, the Pacific Sleeper shark and the Salmon Shark. And sometimes even great white and blue sharks are spotted ste</p>\r\n<p>The salmon shark is perhaps the most familiar Alaska shark. Most common in Prince William Sound, these sharks look like smaller versions of their cousin the great white.</p>\r\n<p>None of these species are targeted for commercial fishing, but there is a small charter fishing industry for salmon sharks.</p>\r\n<p>Alaska Fish and Game biologist Dr. Ken Goldman has been studying sharks in Alaska for decades and the salmon shark in particular.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This animal is one of five different species we know to be endothermic. So they are warm blooded like mammals.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Goldman says the salmon shark&rsquo;s ability to maintain body temperature means it is capable of hunting a diverse range of prey, more than 30 species in fact, including fast swimmers like salmon.</p>\r\n<p>Goldman uses satellite tags to track the sharks&rsquo; movements around the Pacific, accelerometers to study swimming speed and dive patterns, and builds energy models by putting temperature tags in their stomach and muscles.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re kind of radioshacking up the fish up a little bit. Most of the devices come off after a period of time so the fish isn&rsquo;t left with all this jewelry hanging on it for the rest of its life.&rdquo;<br />Goldman says though sharks have been in Alaska waters for tens of millions of years, not that much is known about them.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The reality is for salmon sharks and even for spiny dogfish and sleeper sharks, for all three major species in Alaska we have no real, true population estimate.&rdquo;<br />While few people are doing shark research in Alaska, NOAA&rsquo;s Tribuzio says the number is growing.</p>\r\n<p>Dean Courtney has been a researcher with NOAA for 15 years. He&rsquo;s building computer models that create a realistic range of life history and commercial by catch rates to infer whether the current sleeper shark by catch is sustainable for the population.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s become a conservation issue. Sharks are a relatively long lived and late to mature so they may be more susceptible to overfishing than the target species they&rsquo;re captured with.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Courtney is currently conducting shark research in Florida; he says he encounters people all the time who are surprised to hear that Alaska has sharks.</p>\r\n<p>After 12 years working with spiny dogfish, Tribuzio says she&rsquo;s used to it.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Everybody focuses on what they call charismatic mega fauna, things that are cute and fuzzy or really shocking, sexy science, and spiny dogfish are anything but that. And the same with sleeper sharks, because you very rarely see them. I think that because there is no danger, the most press these species get is when they interact with commercial fisheries and are usually causing problems.&rdquo;<br />Although Alaska waters have fewer sharks, Goldman cautions taking them for granted.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s less sharks here as far as the number of species, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean their role in the ecosystem is less important than an ecosystem that has 40 species of shark.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>aling fish from lines and tangling up nets.</p>\r\n<p>The Spiny Dogfish is a small shark that grows to about 3 feet long. It often turns up on beaches or in nets, particularly around Yakutat. Dogfish also appear in Haida and Tlingit stories and artwork.</p>\r\n<p>The Pacific Sleeper is a much larger but more elusive shark that reaches lengths of 10 to 12 feet. They&rsquo;re a dark, sluggish fish that often aren&rsquo;t seen until they get hooked on long lines or scooped up by deep nets.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
