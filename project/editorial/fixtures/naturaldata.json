    "content": "wf-subsistence0118 Alaska Supreme Court rules in favor of Kookesh, Angoon subsistence fishermen Charges against three Southeast subsistence fishermen \u2014 including former Sen. Albert Kookesh \u2014 have once again been dismissed. Web story recapping trial highlights and following court decision. Charges against three Southeast subsistence fishermen -- including former Sen. Albert Kookesh -- have once again been dismissed. In an opinion issued Friday, the Alaska Supreme Court found that because the regulation used to cite the men was not created lawfully, it&rsquo;s unenforceable. The decision could have a major impact on Department of Fish and Game bag limits across the state.\r\nEstrada v. the State of Alaska concerned three men accused of taking more fish than their permits allowed.&nbsp;A fourth man, Scott Hunter, eventually pled guilty to an amended charge of fishing without a permit.\r\nHunter, Rocky Estrada, Stanley Johnson and former Angoon Sen. Albert Kookesh were cited&nbsp;in July 2009 for harvesting 148 fish; their permits only allowed for 15 sockeye salmon harvested per family from Kanalku Bay near Angoon. Kookesh -- who&rsquo;s served in both bodies of Alaska&rsquo;s Legislature and as chairman of Sealaska -- says he wasn&rsquo;t even fishing that day.\r\n\"When I saw Fish and Game come in and start giving them citations, I was looking for something that would challenge the bag limit,\" Kookesh said.&nbsp;At the time of the citations, he was representing Senate District C, which included a number of Southeast villages.&nbsp;\"When I saw them giving my brothers a citation, I went over and said, 'Here&rsquo;s my permit; I want to get a citation, too.'\"\r\nThe charges were dismissed by a judge at first, but the state appealed.\r\nThe fishermen saw the citations as unfair. Kookesh said no one in Angoon recalled the Department of Fish and Game consulting with locals informally -- which the department claims it did -- let alone officially. If they had, Kookesh says the resulting regulation that set the bag limit may have been more agreeable to locals. He says the department erred in not establishing a definition for \"family\" or explaining how they decided on 15 fish.\r\n\"Less than a mile away from where we got cited, commercial fishermen were fishing, catching all the fish they wanted,\" he said.\r\nIn 2013, the Alaska Court of Appeals reinstated the charges. Their reasoning was that because the Legislature knew the Board of Fisheries was enacting this kind of regulation, their inaction to amend or clarify the board&rsquo;s power indicated that they believed the board acted within its authority.\r\nThat&rsquo;s a conclusion the Supreme Court found to be beside the point.\r\nFor the justices, the question wasn&rsquo;t about the authority to create regulations; it was about whether those regulations were established according to the Administrative Procedures Act -- a law that defines the process for creating a regulation.\r\nHow extensively this decision will affect bag limits across the state is still unknown.\r\n\"This may not just be for the bag limit in Angoon. There are bag limits for everything in the state -- for moose, for deer, for everything. And we don&rsquo;t think that this is going to be such a small Angoon case; it&rsquo;s going to be an Alaska case,\" Kookesh said.\r\nFish and Game Deputy Commissioner Kevin Brooks says the department is also trying to figure out what the decision means for their subsistence management regime.\r\n\"We&rsquo;re going to pull together our directors on Monday morning and with the Department of Law just walk through it,\" Brooks said.&nbsp;\"It has resource management implications and they&rsquo;re pretty varied. It&rsquo;s commercial, sport, subsistence and wildlife. We&rsquo;ve got to spend some time and figure it out.\"\r\nA spokeswoman for the governor said the Walker administration is still reviewing the case.\r\nKookesh says this is just one of many issues surrounding subsistence management in the state that will be challenged over the coming years. He says this case was really about making the department consult with people&nbsp;in rural Alaska.\r\n\"We intended to fight this,\" he said. \"We intended to challenge it and we did. And today after all those years and all that heartache and all that stress, we finally got a result that we think is right.\" Edit   NA",

Web story on ecology conference session on place names Behavioral ecologist Fred Sharpe, Ph.D., of the Alaska Whale Foundation, explained to attendees how researchers were using Tlingit place names to help better understand the historical ecology of Southeast.\r\nSharpe is most concerned about the eastern North Pacific right whale, a highly endangered species with an estimated population of about 30.&nbsp;He said the names of traditional sites or clan houses can indicate that a particular species once populated the area; that&rsquo;s information that could help researchers understand why a species is in decline.\r\n&ldquo;Place names can be very instructive,&rdquo; Sharpe said. &ldquo;We learned that there&rsquo;s a place on Chichagof island called Sea Otter Point. And that&rsquo;s super cool because sea otters aren&rsquo;t there (now)&nbsp;but it does suggest that they were there in the not-too-distant past.&rdquo;\r\nSharpe said Tlingit traditional knowledge has influenced how he thinks about whales.\r\n&ldquo;I think that gaining some insight into the Tlingits&rsquo; perspective has really helped me see how a people can live for centuries, millennia, perhaps even longer with these animals and appreciate them in a nonconsumptive context,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We see that they loved them and were very proud of them. We take incredible inspiration from that to see how you can intelligently manage species.&rdquo;\r\nUsing Tlingit perspective and knowledge as a guide, Sharpe said he hopes to find ways to return to a more equitable relationship with Southeast&rsquo;s whales.\r\nAnother presenter, Allyson Olds, focused her master&rsquo;s thesis on hooligan run times in the Chilkat and Chilkoot rivers. The main goal of her research was to establish a baseline for the annual arrival of the fish. Aside from other forms of research, Olds interviewed 20 people in the area to understand how the population has changed.\r\nLittle research has been done on the fish, which are not currently harvested commercially.\r\nHooligan is a subsistence food source in Southeast and parts of Southcentral. The small, oily fish usually arrive in Alaska streams and rivers in early summer to spawn, making them one of the first fish available for harvest by subsistence users and wildlife.\r\nUnderstanding how climate change may impact run times could be key to sustainable management of the fishery, Olds said.\r\n&ldquo;There&rsquo;s big implications on the influence of climate change, which not only affects run timing of course,&rdquo; Olds said. &ldquo;It affects everything else since so many wildlife predators rely on these.&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;They&rsquo;re not&nbsp;just there, they migrate and they show up for these runs. If that run timing is changing, it can also affect their migrations as well.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;Hello Ready  NA",

Profile of a new film about life before contact. Juneau filmmaker Lisle Hebert is making a film based on Harold Napoleon&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;Yuuyaraq: The Way of the Human Being.&rdquo; Napoleon gave Hebert his blessing to do the adaptation, but he says it&rsquo;ll be a challenge to translate the message to film.\r\nThe beginning of Lisle Hebert&rsquo;s film &ldquo;Yuuyaraq&rdquo; is a re-enactment depicting life on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta before Western contact. The narration stays true to Harold Napoleon&rsquo;s original words.\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s verbatim because his writing is so poetic, and so I couldn&rsquo;t do better than that,&rdquo; Hebert said.\r\nThe re-enactment conveys what the Yup&rsquo;ik word Yuuyaraq means.\r\n&ldquo;Their spiritual beliefs, the way they viewed the world, everything had a spirit. Everything was in harmony and it was kind of like a code of living,&rdquo; Hebert said.\r\nNapoleon wrote Yuuyaraq in 1988 when he was in prison for the death of his son. He says he was so drunk, he blacked out and doesn&rsquo;t remember it. Without any memory of what happened, he couldn&rsquo;t defend himself and so he pled no contest to second degree murder. He never went to trial and no matter&nbsp;how it happened, he blames himself.\r\nHe started writing to figure out why he and so many people he knew struggled with alcohol abuse.\r\nNapoleon is Yup&rsquo;ik Eskimo from Hooper Bay.\r\n&ldquo;I had been baffled for many years about why we knew so very little about our own history and why there was so much shame about our own culture,&rdquo; Napoleon said.\r\nNapoleon is 66. He said he grew up in a very confusing&nbsp;world, being neither fully Yup&rsquo;ik nor white and Christian. There was suffering in the missing pieces of his village&rsquo;s history.\r\n&ldquo;There was also a lot of disconnect between parents and children and that disconnect was not just personal, it was also cultural,&rdquo; Napoleon said.\r\n&ldquo;As children, we were not abandoned literally, but we somehow ended up in nowhere land.&rdquo;Napoleon experienced abuse as a child and drank as an adult. While in prison, he read a lot about trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder in Vietnam War veterans.\r\n&ldquo;Having never been to war and never experienced war or witnessed war, I found it odd that I would have the same symptoms as Vietnam veterans. And not only me but all the other people in my village had the same symptoms,&rdquo; Napoleon said.\r\nAfter more research, Napoleon learned about the flu epidemic of 1918. In Yuuyaraq, he calls it the &ldquo;Great Death&rdquo; and wrote that it spread like wildfire, killing 6 of every 10 people and wiping out Alaskan villages. &ldquo;It gave birth to a generation of orphans,&rdquo; he wrote.\r\nUp until then, Napoleon said Yup&rsquo;ik people had resisted Christianity and white influence.\r\n&ldquo;But after &lsquo;The Great Death,&rsquo; there was mass conversion and people began to abandon, in a sense, their own culture and in abandoning their culture, they abandoned themselves. There was also born in them a sense of shame and guilt because what they were being taught is that the way they had lived their lives had caused them to die in such great numbers,&rdquo; Napoleon said.\r\nHe said&nbsp;the trauma, shame and violence he and others in his village experienced traces back to that time. And it still reverberates today.\r\nWriting Yuuyaraq, Napoleon said, helped him to understand his village and his family, the past and the present.\r\n&ldquo;With understanding there came forgiveness. I had found a trail of truth through our experiences as Native people,&rdquo; he&nbsp;said.\r\nNapoleon said Alaska Native cultures are going through a reawakening and he hopes Lisle Hebert&rsquo;s film adaptation of Yuuyaraq will contribute to it.\r\n&ldquo;If the young people become interested in their own stories, in their own history, then I think it will have done a good job,&rdquo; Napoleon said.\r\nAs a young man, Hebert said he spent time in Hollywood and used to be egotistical about filmmaking, but Yuuyaraq is about something else.\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping that people will be moved by it and have more compassion and also realize what (Alaska Natives)&nbsp;have been through, and try to look at people like people,&rdquo; Hebert said.\r\nFor Hebert, Yuuyaraq is a meaningful film, and that has given meaning to his own life.

Web post on Arctic Symposium The University of Washington School of Law is hosting policymakers from Alaska and around the country for discussions on Arctic security and politics, development, transportation and shipping, environmental protection, and climate change.\r\nThe third annual Arctic Encounter Symposium runs Friday through Saturday in Seattle.\r\nElected Alaska officials, academics, municipal and Native corporation representatives, and some of the Coast Guard&rsquo;s top officers are expected to attend.\r\nBethel Rep. Bob Herron is part of a panel that will discuss development of a port system, and improving communications and mapping of the Arctic. He said they&rsquo;ll also talk about reducing heating costs, developing adequate water and sewer systems for Arctic communities, and responding to the effects of climate change.\r\n&ldquo;I think that we have to remind them that maybe we are the best to be deeply involved, and not to take us for granted,&rdquo; Herron said.\r\nLt. Gov. Byron Mallott, Anchorage Sen. Lesil McGuire and Craig Fleener, the Walker administration&rsquo;s Arctic policy adviser, are some of the other Alaskans participating in panel discussions or addressing the conference.\r\nHerron is attending again this year in his role as chair of the House Economic Development, Tourism &amp; Arctic Policy Committee. He admits to being annoyed whenever he hears comments from nonresidents that&nbsp;imply that Alaska needs saving from Alaskans.\r\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not someone&rsquo;s convenient snow globe so they can look inside the snow globe and see all these little fur-clothed, subsistence people living in a zoo, in a museum, in an environment where they must protect it,&rdquo; Herron said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a couple times where I&rsquo;ve felt that I&rsquo;ve been patted on the head and they&rsquo;ve said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ll take care of you.'&rdquo;\r\nAlaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell, co-chair and ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee respectively, will also attend the symposium.\r\nHerron said it&rsquo;s good that the symposium is being held in Seattle this year.\r\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to bridge this Pacific Northwest, western Canada future,&rdquo; Herron said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t separate Alaska from the Arctic. You can&rsquo;t separate Alaska from our Canadian neighbors. And, even though we&rsquo;re not directly connected to the Pacific Northwest, we still have all that history.&rdquo; Ready  NA",

The U.S. provides Israel with $3 billion in foreign military financing annually, according to the Department of State.\r\nHaytham misses living in Haines, but he says, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really wish to be there right now. My country now needs me. If everyone wishes to be outside, nobody is going to be in Gaza.

With interest in this topic piqued by the centennial, the group will discuss their ongoing efforts to observe gravitational waves.\r\n\r\nLIGO, a system of two identical detectors carefully constructed to detect incredibly tiny vibrations from passing gravitational waves, was conceived and built by MIT and Caltech researchers, funded by the National Science Foundation, with significant contributions from other U.S. and international partners. The twin detectors are located in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington. Research and analysis of data from the detectors is carried out by a global group of scientists, including the LSC, which includes the GEO600 Collaboration, and the VIRGO Collaboration.\r\n\r\nFor additional background about the project, you may be interested in these websites:\r\n\r\n    LIGO Lab: https://ligo.caltech.edu/ (Observatories: Livingston | Hanford)\r\n    Advanced LIGO: https://www.advancedligo.mit.edu/\r\n    LIGO Scientific Collaboration: http://www.ligo.org/\r\n    LIGO Partner Experiments and Collaborations: http://www.ligo.org/partners.php\r\n\r\n- See more at: http://www.ligo.org/news/media-advisory.php#sthash.nElbe2nN.dpuf",

Print story about Alaska Women's Legal Rights handbook The Alaska Women&rsquo;s Legal Rights handbook was first published more than 30 years ago. The latest edition, which was released last month, is 240 pages long and includes information on victim&rsquo;s rights, employment, reproductive rights, safety planning and more.\r\n&ldquo;It just gives women a broad overview on a broad array of legal topics that they could confront at any time in their life. And it&rsquo;s great that we&rsquo;re able to offer it online now, too, because anyone can access this at any time,&rdquo; says Christine Pate, a legal advocate with the Alaska Network on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault.\r\nThe organization Pate works for published the most recent edition of the handbook. She says the handbook is for anyone in the general public who is affected by domestic violence or sexual assault. But she knows that some people might ask why it is specifically a &ldquo;women&rsquo;s&rdquo; handbook.\r\nIn a 2010 survey, 59 percent of Alaskan women reported experiencing intimate partner violence, sexual violence or both at least once in her lifetime.\r\nAnyone can be a victim of domestic violence and the new handbook acknowledges violence in same-sex relationships. Pate says the information in the handbook is useful to any victim, but it is written using female pronouns.\r\n&ldquo;A lot of the issues that are addressed here, women are the primary victims of sexual assault, domestic violence and it&rsquo;s also our experience, and I think research shows that women, especially when there is a legal problem in perhaps a family law case, have less access to resources,&rdquo; Pate says.\r\nIn communities off the road system with little or no law enforcement, the hurdles to leave an abusive situation are different. Ariel Herman, a training coordinator at ANDVSA, says that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t prepare.\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be different contextually depending on if you&rsquo;re in a village or in Juneau or Anchorage but the idea of being ready to leave is something that we can all talk about no matter where our context is,&rdquo; Herman says.\r\nThe handbook includes a seven-page outline for creating a safety plan. It includes a section where the victim can write down important telephone numbers to their local police department or district attorney&rsquo;s office.\r\n&ldquo;Where can you go, who can you talk to? Not everyone feels comfortable talking to the police, so who else can they contact? And also we recognize that not every community has police,&rdquo; Herman says. &ldquo;Your kids, do they know how to use the phone or radio in your community to know who to talk to?&rdquo;\r\nThere&rsquo;s a checklist for what the victim should consider taking with her before leaving. The list includes practical items such as Social Security cards for herself and her children, birth and marriage certificates, medications, credit cards, a checkbook, a copy of her divorce papers or protective order. There are also things a victim might not think of in an emergency: jewelry, photo albums, a child&rsquo;s favorite blanket or toy, pets.\r\nFor a victim whose abuser has left the home, there&rsquo;s another list to prepare her if he returns: Change the locks, install outside lighting and purchase rope ladders to escape from second floor windows. Those are just a few of the safety measures listed. There are also tips on how to protect the privacy of phone and email communications.\r\n&ldquo;The safety plan unfortunately cannot prevent all abuse and that&rsquo;s because the abuse is not in the control of the victim or the victim&rsquo;s advocate,&rdquo; Herman says. &ldquo;It is in the control of the abuser.&rdquo;\r\nThe last page of the handbook includes phone numbers for domestic violence and sexual assault programs across the state. Most women&rsquo;s shelters and advocacy organizations have hard copies of the handbook; ANDVSA.org has a digital version. Needs Review  NA",

Print version with additional context The LIGO detections represent a much-awaited first step toward opening a whole new branch of astrophysics. Nearly everything we know about the universe comes from detecting and analyzing light in all its forms across the electromagnetic spectrum &ndash; radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. The study of gravitational waves opens a new window on the universe, one that scientists expect will provide key information that will complement what we can learn through electromagnetic radiation.&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nJust as in other areas of astronomy, astronomers need both ground-based and space-based observatories to take full advantage of this new window. LIGO is sensitive to gravitational waves within the range of 10 to 1,000 cycles per second (10 to 1,000 Hz). A space-based system would be able to detect waves at much lower frequencies, from 0.0001 to 0.1 Hz, and detect different types of sources. NASA is working closely with the European Space Agency (ESA) to develop a concept for a space-based gravitational wave observatory. In Progress Use as needed ",

When we hear a near bomb, we are saying that our house is going to be the next one,&rdquo; Haytham says.<br />His family has an emergency bag packed with their identification and other important documents. If they get a call that their house will be bombed, they&rsquo;re ready to evacuate.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;My family is lucky &lsquo;til now that nobody died and they didn&rsquo;t see anyone dying,&rdquo; Haytham says.</p>\r\n<p>At the moment, he is living with 14 people &ndash; his parents, grandmother, three siblings and his aunt&rsquo;s family.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Her house kind of is near the tanks and the bombs, so she&rsquo;s scared and ran away from there and she came to our house,&rdquo; Haytham says.</p>\r\n<p>His parents and siblings sleep on the floor, while his aunt&rsquo;s family shares the six beds in the house. It&rsquo;s crowded, but up to 50 people have stayed in the house during other wars. This is Haytham&rsquo;s third.</p>\r\n<p>Haytham says they haven&rsquo;t had electricity for more than a week. His family has their own gas-run generator, which they turn on to charge flashlights, laptops and phones. They also use it to pump water to the house.</p>\r\n<p>Without a refrigerator, Haytham&rsquo;s father takes the risk of going to the market a few times a week.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In the U.S. we had fulltime electricity, we have water all the time, we have freedom to go anywhere. But here, I can be scared to go out to get the trash out of the house and I&rsquo;ll be scared if I&rsquo;m going to go to our neighbors&rsquo; to drink some tea or something. It&rsquo;s really hard to get out, even from the house,&rdquo; Haytham says.</p>\r\n<p>The last time Haytham went outside was more than 10 days ago during a ceasefire. It lasted six hours.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I went to hang out with my friends. We tried to go and get a haircut but the places were very crowded so we didn&rsquo;t have a haircut,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n<p>Everyone was in the streets.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;People were happy, you know, just going out from their houses. Not really happy, just relief, you know,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n<p>Haytham says days pass inside the house doing nothing and he loses track of the date. He only sleeps between 5 and 10 a.m. when bombs are less frequent. He says there are more bombs at night.</p>\r\n<p>Inside, Haytham says his family still occasionally laughs.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not the laugh that comes from the heart. We just laugh to let my 6-year-old brother to laugh and feel that he&rsquo;s safe and we&rsquo;re not in danger,&rdquo; he says.<br />Haytham has mixed feelings toward the U.S. due to its relationship with Israel. The U.S. provides Israel with $3 billion in foreign military financing annually, according to the Department of State.</p>\r\n<p>Haytham misses living in Haines, but he says, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really wish to be there right now. My country now needs me. If everyone wishes to be outside, nobody is going to be in Gaza. There should be people staying in Gaza so they can protect it and after the war, they can build it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Haytham is supposed to start his senior year of high school at the end of the month. But, he says, schools have delayed opening. Even if the war ends soon, it&rsquo;ll still take time to repair.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

So they are warm blooded like mammals.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Goldman says the salmon shark&rsquo;s ability to maintain body temperature means it is capable of hunting a diverse range of prey, more than 30 species in fact, including fast swimmers like salmon.</p>\r\n<p>Goldman uses satellite tags to track the sharks&rsquo; movements around the Pacific, accelerometers to study swimming speed and dive patterns, and builds energy models by putting temperature tags in their stomach and muscles.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re kind of radioshacking up the fish up a little bit. Most of the devices come off after a period of time so the fish isn&rsquo;t left with all this jewelry hanging on it for the rest of its life.&rdquo;<br />Goldman says though sharks have been in Alaska waters for tens of millions of years, not that much is known about them.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The reality is for salmon sharks and even for spiny dogfish and sleeper sharks, for all three major species in Alaska we have no real, true population estimate.&rdquo;<br />While few people are doing shark research in Alaska, NOAA&rsquo;s Tribuzio says the number is growing.</p>\r\n<p>Dean Courtney has been a researcher with NOAA for 15 years. He&rsquo;s building computer models that create a realistic range of life history and commercial by catch rates to infer whether the current sleeper shark by catch is sustainable for the population.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s become a conservation issue. Sharks are a relatively long lived and late to mature so they may be more susceptible to overfishing than the target species they&rsquo;re captured with.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Courtney is currently conducting shark research in Florida; he says he encounters people all the time who are surprised to hear that Alaska has sharks.</p>\r\n<p>After 12 years working with spiny dogfish, Tribuzio says she&rsquo;s used to it.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Everybody focuses on what they call charismatic mega fauna, things that are cute and fuzzy or really shocking, sexy science, and spiny dogfish are anything but that. And the same with sleeper sharks, because you very rarely see them. I think that because there is no danger, the most press these species get is when they interact with commercial fisheries and are usually causing problems.&rdquo;<br />Although Alaska waters have fewer sharks, Goldman cautions taking them for granted.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s less sharks here as far as the number of species, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean their role in the ecosystem is less important than an ecosystem that has 40 species of shark.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>aling fish from lines and tangling up nets.</p>\r\n<p>The Spiny Dogfish is a small shark that grows to about 3 feet long. It often turns up on beaches or in nets, particularly around Yakutat. Dogfish also appear in Haida and Tlingit stories and artwork.</p>\r\n<p>The Pacific Sleeper is a much larger but more elusive shark that reaches lengths of 10 to 12 feet. They&rsquo;re a dark, sluggish fish that often aren&rsquo;t seen until they get hooked on long lines or scooped up by deep nets.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "wf_content": "<p>Behavioral ecologist Fred Sharpe, Ph.D., of the Alaska Whale Foundation, explained to attendees how researchers were using Tlingit place names to help better understand the historical ecology of Southeast.</p>\r\n<p>Sharpe is most concerned about the eastern North Pacific right whale, a highly endangered species with an estimated population of about 30.<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">&nbsp;</span>He said the names of traditional sites or clan houses can indicate that a particular species once populated the area; that&rsquo;s information that could help researchers understand why a species is in decline.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Place names can be very instructive,&rdquo; Sharpe said. &ldquo;We learned that there&rsquo;s a place on Chichagof island called Sea Otter Point. And that&rsquo;s super cool because sea otters aren&rsquo;t there (now)&nbsp;but it does suggest that they were there in the not-too-distant past.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Sharpe said Tlingit traditional knowledge has influenced how he thinks about whales.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think that gaining some insight into the Tlingits&rsquo; perspective has really helped me see how a people can live for centuries, millennia, perhaps even longer with these animals and appreciate them in a nonconsumptive context,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We see that they loved them and were very proud of them. We take incredible inspiration from that to see how you can intelligently manage species.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Using Tlingit perspective and knowledge as a guide, Sharpe said he hopes to find ways to return to a more equitable relationship with Southeast&rsquo;s whales.</p>\r\n<p>Another presenter, Allyson Olds, focused her master&rsquo;s thesis on hooligan run times in the Chilkat and Chilkoot rivers. The main goal of her research was to establish a baseline for the annual arrival of the fish. Aside from other forms of research, Olds interviewed 20 people in the area to understand how the population has changed.</p>\r\n<p>Little research has been done on the fish, which are not currently harvested commercially.</p>\r\n<p>Hooligan is a subsistence food source in Southeast and parts of Southcentral. The small, oily fish usually arrive in Alaska streams and rivers in early summer to spawn, making them one of the first fish available for harvest by subsistence users and wildlife.</p>\r\n<p>Understanding how climate change may impact run times could be key to sustainable management of the fishery, Olds said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s big implications on the influence of climate change, which not only affects run timing of course,&rdquo; Olds said. &ldquo;It affects everything else since so many wildlife predators rely on <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">these.</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000;\">&hellip;&nbsp;They&rsquo;re not&nbsp;just there</span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,</span> they migrate and they show up for these runs. If that run timing is changing, it can also affect their migrations as well.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "wf_content": "<p>Charges against three Southeast subsistence fishermen -- including former Sen. Albert Kookesh -- have once again been dismissed. In an opinion issued Friday, the Alaska Supreme Court found that because the regulation used to cite the men was not created lawfully, it&rsquo;s unenforceable. The decision could have a major impact on Department of Fish and Game bag limits across the state.</p>\r\n<p>Estrada v. the State of Alaska concerned three men accused of taking more fish than their permits allowed.&nbsp;A fourth man, Scott Hunter, eventually pled guilty to an amended charge of fishing without a permit.</p>\r\n<p>Hunter, Rocky Estrada, Stanley Johnson and former Angoon Sen. Albert Kookesh were cited&nbsp;in July 2009 for harvesting 148 fish; their permits only allowed for 15 sockeye salmon harvested per family from Kanalku Bay near Angoon. Kookesh -- who&rsquo;s served in both bodies of Alaska&rsquo;s Legislature and as chairman of Sealaska -- says he wasn&rsquo;t even fishing that day.</p>\r\n<p>\"When I saw Fish and Game come in and start giving them citations, I was looking for something that would challenge the bag limit,\" Kookesh said.&nbsp;At the time of the citations, he was representing Senate District C, which included a number of Southeast villages.&nbsp;\"When I saw them giving my brothers a citation, I went over and said, 'Here&rsquo;s my permit; I want to get a citation, too.'\"</p>\r\n<p>The charges were dismissed by a judge at first, but the state appealed.</p>\r\n<p>The fishermen saw the citations as unfair. Kookesh said no one in Angoon recalled the Department of Fish and Game consulting with locals informally -- which the department claims it did -- let alone officially. If they had, Kookesh says the resulting regulation that set the bag limit may have been more agreeable to locals. He says the department erred in not establishing a definition for \"family\" or explaining how they decided on 15 fish.</p>\r\n<p>\"Less than a mile away from where we got cited, commercial fishermen were fishing, catching all the fish they wanted,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>In 2013, the Alaska Court of Appeals reinstated the charges. Their reasoning was that because the Legislature knew the Board of Fisheries was enacting this kind of regulation, their inaction to amend or clarify the board&rsquo;s power indicated that they believed the board acted within its authority.</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a conclusion the Supreme Court found to be beside the point.</p>\r\n<p>For the justices, the question wasn&rsquo;t about the authority to create regulations; it was about whether those regulations were established according to the Administrative Procedures Act -- a law that defines the process for creating a regulation.</p>\r\n<p>How extensively this decision will affect bag limits across the state is still unknown.</p>\r\n<p>\"This may not just be for the bag limit in Angoon. There are bag limits for everything in the state -- for moose, for deer, for everything. And we don&rsquo;t think that this is going to be such a small Angoon case; it&rsquo;s going to be an Alaska case,\" Kookesh said.</p>\r\n<p>Fish and Game Deputy Commissioner Kevin Brooks says the department is also trying to figure out what the decision means for their subsistence management regime.</p>\r\n<p>\"We&rsquo;re going to pull together our directors on Monday morning and with the Department of Law just walk through it,\" Brooks said.&nbsp;\"It has resource management implications and they&rsquo;re pretty varied. It&rsquo;s commercial, sport, subsistence and wildlife. We&rsquo;ve got to spend some time and figure it out.\"</p>\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for the governor said the Walker administration is still reviewing the case.</p>\r\n<p>Kookesh says this is just one of many issues surrounding subsistence management in the state that will be challenged over the coming years. He says this case was really about making the department consult with people&nbsp;in rural Alaska.</p>\r\n<p>\"We intended to fight this,\" he said. \"We intended to challenge it and we did. And today after all those years and all that heartache and all that stress, we finally got a result that we think is right.\"</p>",

And that&rsquo;s super cool because sea otters aren&rsquo;t there (now)&nbsp;but it does suggest that they were there in the not-too-distant past.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Sharpe said Tlingit traditional knowledge has influenced how he thinks about whales.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think that gaining some insight into the Tlingits&rsquo; perspective has really helped me see how a people can live for centuries, millennia, perhaps even longer with these animals and appreciate them in a nonconsumptive context,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We see that they loved them and were very proud of them. We take incredible inspiration from that to see how you can intelligently manage species.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Using Tlingit perspective and knowledge as a guide, Sharpe said he hopes to find ways to return to a more equitable relationship with Southeast&rsquo;s whales.</p>\r\n<p>Another presenter, Allyson Olds, focused her master&rsquo;s thesis on hooligan run times in the Chilkat and Chilkoot rivers. The main goal of her research was to establish a baseline for the annual arrival of the fish. Aside from other forms of research, Olds interviewed 20 people in the area to understand how the population has changed.</p>\r\n<p>Little research has been done on the fish, which are not currently harvested commercially.</p>\r\n<p>Hooligan is a subsistence food source in Southeast and parts of Southcentral. The small, oily fish usually arrive in Alaska streams and rivers in early summer to spawn, making them one of the first fish available for harvest by subsistence users and wildlife.</p>\r\n<p>Understanding how climate change may impact run times could be key to sustainable management of the fishery, Olds said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s big implications on the influence of climate change, which not only affects run timing of course,&rdquo; Olds said. &ldquo;It affects everything else since so many wildlife predators rely on <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">these.</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000;\">&hellip;&nbsp;They&rsquo;re not&nbsp;just there</span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,</span> they migrate and they show up for these runs.

The narration stays true to Harold Napoleon&rsquo;s original words.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s verbatim because his writing is so poetic, and so I couldn&rsquo;t do better than that,&rdquo; Hebert said.</p>\r\n<p>The re-enactment conveys what the Yup&rsquo;ik word Yuuyaraq means.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Their spiritual beliefs, the way they viewed the world, everything had a spirit. Everything was in harmony and it was kind of like a code of living,&rdquo; Hebert said.</p>\r\n<p>Napoleon wrote Yuuyaraq in 1988 when he was in prison for the death of his son. He says he was so drunk, he blacked out and doesn&rsquo;t remember it. Without any memory of what happened, he couldn&rsquo;t defend himself and so he pled no contest to second degree murder. He never went to trial and no matter&nbsp;how it happened, he blames himself.</p>\r\n<p>He started writing to figure out why he and so many people he knew struggled with alcohol abuse.</p>\r\n<p>Napoleon is Yup&rsquo;ik Eskimo from Hooper Bay.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I had been baffled for many years about why we knew so very little about our own history and why there was so much shame about our own culture,&rdquo; Napoleon said.</p>\r\n<p>Napoleon is 66. He said he grew up in a very confusing&nbsp;world, being neither fully Yup&rsquo;ik nor white and Christian. There was suffering in the missing pieces of his village&rsquo;s history.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There was also a lot of disconnect between parents and children and that disconnect was not just personal, it was also cultural,&rdquo; Napoleon said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;As children, we were not abandoned literally, but we somehow ended up in nowhere land.&rdquo;<br />Napoleon experienced abuse as a child and drank as an adult. While in prison, he read a lot about trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder in Vietnam War veterans.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Having never been to war and never experienced war or witnessed war, I found it odd that I would have the same symptoms as Vietnam veterans. And not only me but all the other people in my village had the same symptoms,&rdquo; Napoleon said.</p>\r\n<p>After more research, Napoleon learned about the flu epidemic of 1918. In Yuuyaraq, he calls it the &ldquo;Great Death&rdquo; and wrote that it spread like wildfire, killing 6 of every 10 people and wiping out Alaskan villages. &ldquo;It gave birth to a generation of orphans,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>\r\n<p>Up until then, Napoleon said Yup&rsquo;ik people had resisted Christianity and white influence.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But after &lsquo;The Great Death,&rsquo; there was mass conversion and people began to abandon, in a sense, their own culture and in abandoning their culture, they abandoned themselves. There was also born in them a sense of shame and guilt because what they were being taught is that the way they had lived their lives had caused them to die in such great numbers,&rdquo; Napoleon said.</p>\r\n<p>He said&nbsp;the trauma, shame and violence he and others in his village experienced traces back to that time. And it still reverberates today.</p>\r\n<p>Writing Yuuyaraq, Napoleon said, helped him to understand his village and his family, the past and the present.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;With understanding there came forgiveness. I had found a trail of truth through our experiences as Native people,&rdquo; he&nbsp;said.</p>\r\n<p>Napoleon said Alaska Native cultures are going through a reawakening and he hopes Lisle Hebert&rsquo;s film adaptation of Yuuyaraq will contribute to it.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If the young people become interested in their own stories, in their own history, then I think it will have done a good job,&rdquo; Napoleon said.</p>\r\n<p>As a young man, Hebert said he spent time in Hollywood and used to be egotistical about filmmaking, but Yuuyaraq is about something else.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping that people will be moved by it and have more compassion and also realize what (Alaska Natives)&nbsp;have been through, and try to look at people like people,&rdquo; Hebert said.</p>\r\n<p>For Hebert, Yuuyaraq is a meaningful film, and that has given meaning to his own life.</p>",

Bob Herron is part of a panel that will discuss development of a port system, and improving communications and mapping of the Arctic. He said they&rsquo;ll also talk about reducing heating costs, developing adequate water and sewer systems for Arctic communities, and responding to the effects of climate change.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think that we have to remind them that maybe we are the best to be deeply involved, and not to take us for granted,&rdquo; Herron said.</p>\r\n<p>Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott, Anchorage Sen. Lesil McGuire and Craig Fleener, the Walker administration&rsquo;s Arctic policy adviser, are some of the other Alaskans participating in panel discussions or addressing the conference.</p>\r\n<p>Herron is attending again this year in his role as chair of the House Economic Development, Tourism &amp; Arctic Policy Committee. He admits to being annoyed whenever he hears comments from nonresidents that&nbsp;imply that Alaska needs saving from Alaskans.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not someone&rsquo;s convenient snow globe so they can look inside the snow globe and see all these little fur-clothed, subsistence people living in a zoo, in a museum, in an environment where they must protect it,&rdquo; Herron said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a couple times where I&rsquo;ve felt that I&rsquo;ve been patted on the head and they&rsquo;ve said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ll take care of you.'&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell, co-chair and ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee respectively, will also attend the symposium.</p>\r\n<p>Herron said it&rsquo;s good that the symposium is being held in Seattle this year.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to bridge this Pacific Northwest, western Canada future,&rdquo; Herron said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t separate Alaska from the Arctic. You can&rsquo;t separate Alaska from our Canadian neighbors. And, even though we&rsquo;re not directly connected to the Pacific Northwest, we still have all that history.&rdquo;</p>",

    "pf_content": "<p>The Alaska Women&rsquo;s Legal Rights handbook was first published more than 30 years ago. The latest edition, which was released last month, is 240 pages long and includes information on victim&rsquo;s rights, employment, reproductive rights, safety planning and more.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It just gives women a broad overview on a broad array of legal topics that they could confront at any time in their life. And it&rsquo;s great that we&rsquo;re able to offer it online now, too, because anyone can access this at any time,&rdquo; says Christine Pate, a legal advocate with the Alaska Network on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault.</p>\r\n<p>The organization Pate works for published the most recent edition of the handbook. She says the handbook is for anyone in the general public who is affected by domestic violence or sexual assault. But she knows that some people might ask why it is specifically a &ldquo;women&rsquo;s&rdquo; handbook.</p>\r\n<p>In a 2010 survey, 59 percent of Alaskan women reported experiencing intimate partner violence, sexual violence or both at least once in her lifetime.</p>\r\n<p>Anyone can be a victim of domestic violence and the new handbook acknowledges violence in same-sex relationships. Pate says the information in the handbook is useful to any victim, but it is written using female pronouns.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of the issues that are addressed here, women are the primary victims of sexual assault, domestic violence and it&rsquo;s also our experience, and I think research shows that women, especially when there is a legal problem in perhaps a family law case, have less access to resources,&rdquo; Pate says.</p>\r\n<p>In communities off the road system with little or no law enforcement, the hurdles to leave an abusive situation are different. Ariel Herman, a training coordinator at ANDVSA, says that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t prepare.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be different contextually depending on if you&rsquo;re in a village or in Juneau or Anchorage but the idea of being ready to leave is something that we can all talk about no matter where our context is,&rdquo; Herman says.</p>\r\n<p>The handbook includes a seven-page outline for creating a safety plan. It includes a section where the victim can write down important telephone numbers to their local police department or district attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Where can you go, who can you talk to? Not everyone feels comfortable talking to the police, so who else can they contact? And also we recognize that not every community has police,&rdquo; Herman says. &ldquo;Your kids, do they know how to use the phone or radio in your community to know who to talk to?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a checklist for what the victim should consider taking with her before leaving. The list includes practical items such as Social Security cards for herself and her children, birth and marriage certificates, medications, credit cards, a checkbook, a copy of her divorce papers or protective order. There are also things a victim might not think of in an emergency: jewelry, photo albums, a child&rsquo;s favorite blanket or toy, pets.</p>\r\n<p>For a victim whose abuser has left the home, there&rsquo;s another list to prepare her if he returns: Change the locks, install outside lighting and purchase rope ladders to escape from second floor windows. Those are just a few of the safety measures listed. There are also tips on how to protect the privacy of phone and email communications.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The safety plan unfortunately cannot prevent all abuse and that&rsquo;s because the abuse is not in the control of the victim or the victim&rsquo;s advocate,&rdquo; Herman says. &ldquo;It is in the control of the abuser.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The last page of the handbook includes phone numbers for domestic violence and sexual assault programs across the state. Most women&rsquo;s shelters and advocacy organizations have hard copies of the handbook; ANDVSA.org has a digital version.</p>",

Nearly everything we know about the universe comes from detecting and analyzing light in all its forms across the electromagnetic spectrum &ndash; radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. The study of gravitational waves opens a new window on the universe, one that scientists expect will provide key information that will complement what we can learn through electromagnetic radiation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Just as in other areas of astronomy, astronomers need both ground-based and space-based observatories to take full advantage of this new window. LIGO is sensitive to gravitational waves within the range of 10 to 1,000 cycles per second (10 to 1,000 Hz). A space-based system would be able to detect waves at much lower frequencies, from 0.0001 to 0.1 Hz, and detect different types of sources. NASA is working closely with the European Space Agency (ESA) to develop <a href=\"https://www.elisascience.org/\">a concept for a space-based gravitational wave observatory</a>.</p>",

    "pf_content": "<p>The Alaska Women&rsquo;s Legal Rights handbook was first published more than 30 years ago. The latest edition, which was released last month, is 240 pages long and includes information on victim&rsquo;s rights, employment, reproductive rights, safety planning and more.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It just gives women a broad overview on a broad array of legal topics that they could confront at any time in their life. And it&rsquo;s great that we&rsquo;re able to offer it online now, too, because anyone can access this at any time,&rdquo; says Christine Pate, a legal advocate with the Alaska Network on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault.</p>\r\n<p>The organization Pate works for published the most recent edition of the handbook. She says the handbook is for anyone in the general public who is affected by domestic violence or sexual assault. But she knows that some people might ask why it is specifically a &ldquo;women&rsquo;s&rdquo; handbook.</p>\r\n<p>In a 2010 survey, 59 percent of Alaskan women reported experiencing intimate partner violence, sexual violence or both at least once in her lifetime.</p>\r\n<p>Anyone can be a victim of domestic violence and the new handbook acknowledges violence in same-sex relationships. Pate says the information in the handbook is useful to any victim, but it is written using female pronouns.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of the issues that are addressed here, women are the primary victims of sexual assault, domestic violence and it&rsquo;s also our experience, and I think research shows that women, especially when there is a legal problem in perhaps a family law case, have less access to resources,&rdquo; Pate says.</p>\r\n<p>In communities off the road system with little or no law enforcement, the hurdles to leave an abusive situation are different. Ariel Herman, a training coordinator at ANDVSA, says that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t prepare.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be different contextually depending on if you&rsquo;re in a village or in Juneau or Anchorage but the idea of being ready to leave is something that we can all talk about no matter where our context is,&rdquo; Herman says.</p>\r\n<p>The handbook includes a seven-page outline for creating a safety plan. It includes a section where the victim can write down important telephone numbers to their local police department or district attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Where can you go, who can you talk to? Not everyone feels comfortable talking to the police, so who else can they contact? And also we recognize that not every community has police,&rdquo; Herman says. &ldquo;Your kids, do they know how to use the phone or radio in your community to know who to talk to?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a checklist for what the victim should consider taking with her before leaving. The list includes practical items such as Social Security cards for herself and her children, birth and marriage certificates, medications, credit cards, a checkbook, a copy of her divorce papers or protective order. There are also things a victim might not think of in an emergency: jewelry, photo albums, a child&rsquo;s favorite blanket or toy, pets.</p>\r\n<p>For a victim whose abuser has left the home, there&rsquo;s another list to prepare her if he returns: Change the locks, install outside lighting and purchase rope ladders to escape from second floor windows. Those are just a few of the safety measures listed. There are also tips on how to protect the privacy of phone and email communications.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The safety plan unfortunately cannot prevent all abuse and that&rsquo;s because the abuse is not in the control of the victim or the victim&rsquo;s advocate,&rdquo; Herman says. &ldquo;It is in the control of the abuser.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The last page of the handbook includes phone numbers for domestic violence and sexual assault programs across the state. Most women&rsquo;s shelters and advocacy organizations have hard copies of the handbook; ANDVSA.org has a digital version.</p>",

    "pf_content": "<p>The LIGO detections represent a much-awaited first step toward opening a whole new branch of astrophysics. Nearly everything we know about the universe comes from detecting and analyzing light in all its forms across the electromagnetic spectrum &ndash; radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. The study of gravitational waves opens a new window on the universe, one that scientists expect will provide key information that will complement what we can learn through electromagnetic radiation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Just as in other areas of astronomy, astronomers need both ground-based and space-based observatories to take full advantage of this new window. LIGO is sensitive to gravitational waves within the range of 10 to 1,000 cycles per second (10 to 1,000 Hz). A space-based system would be able to detect waves at much lower frequencies, from 0.0001 to 0.1 Hz, and detect different types of sources. NASA is working closely with the European Space Agency (ESA) to develop <a href=\"https://www.elisascience.org/\">a concept for a space-based gravitational wave observatory</a>.</p>",

    "text": "For Immediate Release: Monday, February 8, 2016\r\nTHURSDAY: Scientists to provide update on the search for gravitational waves\r\n\r\n100 years after Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves, the National Science Foundation gathers scientists from Caltech, MIT and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to update the scientific community on efforts to detect them.\r\n\r\n(Washington, DC) -- Journalists are invited to join the National Science Foundation as it brings together the scientists from Caltech, MIT and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) this Thursday at 10:30 a.m. at the National Press Club for a status report on the effort to detect gravitational waves - or ripples in the fabric of spacetime - using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO).\r\n\r\nThis year marks the 100th anniversary of the first publication of Albert Einstein's prediction of the existence of gravitational waves. With interest in this topic piqued by the centennial, the group will discuss their ongoing efforts to observe gravitational waves.\r\n\r\nLIGO, a system of two identical detectors carefully constructed to detect incredibly tiny vibrations from passing gravitational waves, was conceived and built by MIT and Caltech researchers, funded by the National Science Foundation, with significant contributions from other U.S. and international partners. The twin detectors are located in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington. Research and analysis of data from the detectors is carried out by a global group of scientists, including the LSC, which includes the GEO600 Collaboration, and the VIRGO Collaboration.\r\n\r\nFor additional background about the project, you may be interested in these websites:\r\n\r\n    LIGO Lab: https://ligo.caltech.edu/ (Observatories: Livingston | Hanford)\r\n    Advanced LIGO: https://www.advancedligo.mit.edu/\r\n    LIGO Scientific Collaboration: http://www.ligo.org/\r\n    LIGO Partner Experiments and Collaborations: http://www.ligo.org/partners.php\r\n\r\n- See more at: http://www.ligo.org/news/media-advisory.php#sthash.nElbe2nN.dpuf",
