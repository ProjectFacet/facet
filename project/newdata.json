Unalaska residents are angry over graffiti on a historical military bunker. #722LIFE. MORGENTHUGS.\r\nThat statement has been splashed across the side of a World War II bunker in Unalaska, leaving some residents outraged on social media.\r\nOn a rare sunny day in March, Dmitri Dane hiked up the back side of Mount Ballyhoo, where military structures from World War II still look out over the Bering Sea.\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing,&rdquo; said Dane. &ldquo;You can see the mountain range, you can see Hog Island, and the bunkers are on the very edge of the cliff.&rdquo;\r\nAs a landscape photographer, Dane said it&rsquo;s one of the best views in Unalaska. But as he walked out to the bunker on the farthest bluff, he came across something not so beautiful.\r\n&ldquo;I was very surprised to see the bunker at the very end had a lot of graffiti on there,&rdquo; he said.\r\nTagging isn&rsquo;t unusual on the island, even for historic structures like bunkers and barracks. But these big black letters were spray-painted on the outside of the bunker &mdash; not hidden inside like most graffiti.\r\nDane snapped a photo of the tag, posted it on Facebook, and watched as the comments poured in.\r\n&ldquo;I got a lot of angry people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not at me, but a lot of them were angry toward the supposed people who wrote it on there.&rdquo;\r\nNo one&rsquo;s really sure who tagged the bunker, but the graffiti provides some clues.\r\n&ldquo;It felt like a punch in the gut when you see it has a U.S. Coast Guard tag on it,&rdquo; said Carlin Enlow, director of the Unalaska Convention and Visitors Bureau.\r\nShe saw the photo online and drew the same conclusion as a lot of commenters &mdash; that the bunker was defaced by crew members of the Coast Guard Cutter Morgenthau, designated number 722.\r\nFor years, the cutter has stopped in Unalaska on patrol in the Bering Sea, protecting marine resources and helping with search and rescue.\r\nFor Enlow, that mission makes the tag even harder to stomach.\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a group of people who are supposed to serve and protect us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All these questions come to mind. Obviously, why? Why would you do that?&rdquo;\r\nThe Morgenthau&rsquo;s commanding officer looked into the matter after KUCB requested comment.\r\nThe extent of the Coast Guard&rsquo;s investigation is unclear, but officials say there&rsquo;s &ldquo;no information available&rdquo; to confirm if crew members are responsible.\r\nIn the past, the landowning company has given Coast Guard crews permission to paint the names and numbers of their vessels on blast shields decorating the side of Mount Ballyhoo, where the military stashed munitions during the war.\r\nOunalashka Corporation CEO Chris Salts said the native corporation has always had a good relationship with the Coast Guard, and he&rsquo;s not up in arms over this new piece of graffiti. But he said the corporation will pay to have the bunker cleaned this summer to preserve the area&rsquo;s historical integrity.\r\nMeanwhile, the Coast Guard announced Monday that the Morgenthau is being decommissioned after nearly 50 years of service.\r\nThe State Department is taking control of the cutter and may grant it to a friendly foreign government under the Foreign Assistance Act.\r\nOfficials say other vessels will take over the Morgenthau&rsquo;s mission in the Bering Sea.

The City and Borough of Juneau is looking to expand its boundaries on Admiralty Island. The City and Borough of Juneau is looking to expand its boundaries on Admiralty Island.\r\nThat island is home to Angoon, a community of about 500 people, some of whom fear a nearby land annexation would threaten their subsistence lifestyle.\r\nA meeting between Angoon and the City and Borough of Juneau was supposed to take place this week, but was canceled at the last minute.\r\nAlbert Howard grew up in Angoon. He&rsquo;s served two terms as mayor, is now a member of the Regional School Board and serves as vice president of the local tribe.\r\n&ldquo;I pretty much lived here my whole life,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know one end of the island to the other because I&rsquo;ve hunted it with my dad and now I&rsquo;m hunting it with my son.&rdquo;\r\nSometimes they don&rsquo;t see much on those hunting trips, so Howard says he talks to his son about the land and their rights to it.\r\nIn the late 1970s Admiralty Island became a National Monument, in part because of its cultural significance. It&rsquo;s been inhabited by Tlingit people for over 10,000 years.\r\n&ldquo;Anything that happens on Admiralty Island is for the protection of the indigenous people of the Island,&rdquo; Howard said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in (National) Monument language and it&rsquo;s stated that way. You can find it online. It doesn&rsquo;t say anything about the City and Borough of Juneau. That&rsquo;s pretty clear in the language.&rdquo;\r\nHoward and others in Angoon are worried specifically about a place called Pack Creek.\r\nIt&rsquo;s on eastern Admiralty about halfway between Angoon and Juneau.\r\nPack Creek is a popular bear-viewing place for tourists and hunting spot for locals.\r\nHoward worries if that part of Admiralty Island is annexed, it&rsquo;s resources could be auctioned off.\r\n&ldquo;This island belonged to the elders,&rdquo; Howard said. &ldquo;The elders decided to keep it the way it is and Pack Creek wouldn&rsquo;t be what is it if our elders decided to let everybody log it.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;If land was annexed into the Juneau borough, that does not change land ownership,&rdquo; Juneau City Manager Rorie Watt said. &ldquo;So, with the example of Pack Creek, that would be in the Admiralty Island National Monument, managed by the Forest Service. So even if we annexed that, it would not become City of Juneau land. It would still be Forest Service (land) under that management style.&rdquo;\r\nAnd that Forest Service land in the Pack Creek area is protected from development since it&rsquo;s inside a national monument.\r\nSo why would Juneau want to annex the land if it can&rsquo;t be logged or mined or commercially developed?\r\n&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of reasons,&rdquo; Watt said. &ldquo;If you look at the state and the constitution, the idea behind it is sooner or later the entire state ends up in a borough.&rdquo;\r\nSo, basically incorporating it before anyone else does.\r\nAlaska&rsquo;s constitution says the state must be divided into boroughs, either organized or unorganized.\r\nA study completed in the 1990s laid out possible borough models.\r\nRight now most of Admiralty Island is considered an unorganized borough and remote residents like it that way.\r\nProperty owners in Funter Bay on the north end of the island wrote to the Juneau Assembly is February.\r\nThey don&rsquo;t want to pay additional taxes or adhere to zoning regulations.\r\nWatt said there&rsquo;s no way of knowing how&ndash; much in property taxes this would bring Juneau, since those properties have never been assessed.\r\nHe said there are benefits to being part of the borough. Watt says zoning makes sure the land is managed responsibly.\r\n&ldquo;What we would say to Angoon or anybody else who had property in the areas that we&rsquo;re looking at is that we think there is an economic nexus or cultural nexus or recreation nexus between the areas we propose to annex,&rdquo; Watt said.\r\nJuneau representatives wanted to say that in person this week. Watt and other city officials had planned a trip to Angoon, but the mayor of Angoon, Harriet Silva who declined to comment for this story, canceled the visit.\r\nWatt said it&rsquo;s still early on in the process.\r\nHe hopes to reschedule a visit to Angoon and expects to host public meetings in Juneau in the coming months.

Gibbens says that illegal killings like these undercut the ability for the muskox herd to grow into a population the area could one day legally hunt.\r\n&ldquo;Basically, these satellite herds of muskox that move in from the coast come in and establish new territories,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Gibbens. &ldquo;And the exciting thing about that is if they&rsquo;re not poached, they could set up new herds and new territorial ranges and those herds could grow, possibly, to legally huntable populations.&rdquo;\r\nTroopers salvaged the meat from the two muskoxen and have donated it to charities in Bethel.\r\nAnyone with information about this case can contact the Alaska Wildlife Troopers at 907-574-0491 or Alaska Fish and Wildlife Safeguard at 1-800-478-3377.

And their growing tendency to censor and intimidate researchers and suppress their data.\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s those kinds of things,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When you undermine any credibility in what science tells you, you&rsquo;re really causing, I think, enormous damage to society.&rdquo;\r\nBryan Box will&nbsp;be marching for science in Anchorage because the hostile political environment that followed the Nov. 8 election of Trump cost him his job &ndash; and a shot at a research position with a federal agency in Alaska.\r\n&ldquo;Nov. 10,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my bosses tell me &lsquo;Hey look, because of the election, we&rsquo;re not going to give you that job. And so we&rsquo;re also going to have to let you go from the job that you already have, on Jan. 20.&rsquo;&rdquo;\r\nBox is an Army veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan and went on to earn an undergraduate degree in biological sciences from the University of Alaska Anchorage.\r\nHe asked that the agency that he&rsquo;d hoped to work for not be mentioned in this report, because he&rsquo;d still like to work for it. But for now he and his fellow researchers are just trying to cope with such problems as the loss of scientific data that&rsquo;s been&ldquo;scrubbed&rdquo; from federal websites.\r\n&ldquo;More and more of these researchers were freaking out because huge sections of the (federal) government (online content) were starting to go black, as far as like parts of the EPA website, that sort of thing.&rdquo;\r\nBox is&nbsp;also discouraged by censorship imposed on federal employees by an administration gag order requiring them to gain high-level clearance for release of many kinds of science-related information to the public.\r\n&ldquo;Somebody who has absolutely no idea about our field whatsoever is going to be reading our peer-reviewed journal articles for political correctness, or whatever you want to call it.&rdquo;\r\nFairbanks&rsquo; observance of March for Science will begin at 10 a.m. Saturday at Ryan Middle School, 1450 Cowles St.\r\nThe event will begin with a rally at Ryan followed by a march along Airport Way around the Cowles Street intersection.\r\nBox and Mulder both say they&rsquo;re not particularly politically minded people, and that people of any political affiliation are welcome to participate in the marches &ndash; as long as they support science and research free from political influence.\r\n&ldquo;Science is not by itself political,&rdquo; Mulder said. &ldquo;It is not a partisan march. We really don&rsquo;t care who you voted for. Anybody who&rsquo;s willing to come out and stand up for science &hellip; is very, very welcome.&rdquo;\r\nBox reiterated that emphasis on inclusion.

Lawyers representing the Delta Wind Farm are asking state regulators to deny a tariff filed by Golden Valley Electric Association that argues the utility should not be required to buy more power from the wind farm.\r\nGVEA said it should be exempt from state and federal regulations intended to promote use of renewable energy, because it can&rsquo;t integrate more wind power now without incurring costs that would be passed along to ratepayers.\r\nGVEA President and CEO Cory Borgeson said the utility&rsquo;s leadership turned down Delta Wind Farm owner Mike Craft&rsquo;s offer to produce an additional 13.5 megawatts because, Borgeson said, it would cost ratepayers more money.\r\n&ldquo;Right now, we are unable to accommodate any more wind power, because of the cost &ndash; significant cost &ndash; of backing up wind,&rdquo; Borgeson said.\r\nUtilities must &ldquo;back up&rdquo; wind power with conventional sources to replace the power lost when winds die down.\r\nIn GVEA&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s a couple of diesel-fired generators in North Pole that are kept idling &ndash; and are throttled up quickly, when needed.\r\n&ldquo;When you have to have other sources of generation prepared and ready to go for when wind cuts out, we have to have these turbines running at very slow speeds,&rdquo; Borgeson said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just not very economical, at all.&rdquo;\r\nBorgeson said that inflicts a lot of wear and tear on the aging generators, and it increases Golden Valley&rsquo;s fuel costs by about 15 percent, or some $20 million, according to a GVEA study. He said&nbsp;the offer was declined to keep those costs from showing up in ratepayers&rsquo; monthly bills.\r\n&ldquo;We told them that because of the significant cost of backing up their wind, that the financial harm to our members would be too great,&rdquo; Borgeson said, &ldquo;And (that) we&rsquo;d be unable to purchase any of their power.&rdquo;\r\nThat&rsquo;s the basis of a tariff GVEA filed March 15 with the Regulatory Commission of Alaska, or RCA, that explains why Golden Valley should be exempted from state and federal regulations and policies requiring utilities to buy renewable power, whenever possible.\r\nCraft and his attorney, Teresa Clemmer, say GVEA has failed to make that case.\r\n&ldquo;We think the assumptions that they use to kind of shoehorn that conclusion are totally without merit,&rdquo; Clemmer said.\r\nClemmer&nbsp;and Craft say Golden Valley&rsquo;s tariff is unlawful and &ldquo;riddled with outlandish assumptions and false statements.&rdquo;\r\nClemmer argued in a 527-page response she filed with the RCA last week that the utility&rsquo;s leadership misinterprets and disregards state regulations that were established to help promote renewable-energy sources such as wind.\r\n&ldquo;It was really just a complete rejection of everything the regulations required,&rdquo; Clemmer said.\r\nClemmer zeroed in on Golden Valley&rsquo;s claim that it can only use the older diesel-burning generators to back-up the wind power that&rsquo;s produced by the two-megawatt facility Craft presently operates in Delta, along with GVEA&rsquo;s own 25-megawatt Eva Creek Wind farm, near Healy.\r\n&ldquo;We just think they are misleading the public by trying to say that it&rsquo;s only the diesel-fired power that&rsquo;s going to be backing up the wind,&rdquo; Clemmer said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just ridiculous.&rdquo;\r\nClemmer and Craft argue that GVEA can back-up intermittent wind power with facilities that burn, quote, &ldquo;reasonably priced power,&rdquo; such as coal.\r\nShe said&nbsp;the system should have even more capacity when the 50-megawatt coal-fired Healy 2 plant comes online sometime this year.\r\n&ldquo;They already have enough of their reasonably-priced power on the system to integrate the wind,&rdquo; Clemmer said. &ldquo;But even if they didn&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re bringing on a brand-new coal-fired power plant that will free up a lot of that reasonably priced power to back up wind.&rdquo;\r\nCraft said the decision by GVEA&rsquo;s board members to buy Healy 2 in 2013 and their failure to get the problem-plagued facility up and running after sinking some $175 million in to it, discredits their claim to be protecting members from rate hikes.\r\n&ldquo;That power plant has cost this community an incredible amount of money,&rdquo; Craft said. &ldquo;And we got nothing out of it.&rdquo;\r\nCraft said the 13.5 megawatts his expanded facility would produce would enable GVEA to reduce use of its diesel- and coal-fired generators around Fairbanks, which would help improve the area&rsquo;s air quality.\r\nThe RCA commissioners must rule on GVEA&rsquo;s tariff by May 1.

After hours of debate on the state House floor, an oil tax credit bill is on its way to the Senate. After hours of debate on the state House floor, an oil tax credit bill is on its way to the Senate.\r\nHouse Bill 111 passed, primarily along caucus lines. Proponents said that it will stabilize the state&rsquo;s tax regime and get Alaska a larger share of the profits from its oil.\r\nOpponents said they were rushed in reviewing the latest version of the bill. &nbsp;And, they say that increasing taxes on oil industry when prices are down will drive away the industry Alaska relies on for most of its money.\r\nvolume.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alaska is one step closer to getting another oil tax credit overhaul. Representatives in the State House voted to send a contentious bill over to the Senate.\r\nFacing stiff opposition to a tax hike from Senate Republicans, the House Finance committee that put out the latest version of the bill tied it to a Senate-approved permanent fund bill. They added language that said the permanent fund bill will only pass in the House if the House&rsquo;s version of the oil tax credit bill passes in the Senate.\r\nThe latest oil tax credit overhaul drew a lot of criticism from opponents in the House who said that it goes beyond fixing a cash-for-credit system that many said the state cannot afford.\r\nWasilla Republican Delena Johnson and many of her colleagues in the House minority said they did not have enough time to look over the newest version of the bill. It was put out on Friday.\r\n&ldquo;To take on this bill without understanding the consequence. Having it sneaked in at the last minute, having less than 12 hours to put in amendments, it just doesn&rsquo;t make good sense,&rdquo; she said.\r\nIn its current form, the bill drops a program that offered&nbsp;tax credits that can be transferred to other companies or exchanged for cash for work done on the North Slope. The state&rsquo;s delayed payments on those tax credits has resulted in a tab that will reach about $900 million this year.&nbsp;\r\nThat&rsquo;s a provision that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree with. Especially since there have been large discoveries on the North Slope that could leave the state on the hook for billions in credit liabilities before it makes any taxes or royalties from those developments.&nbsp;\r\nProponents of the bill said that it&rsquo;s a better idea to reform the tax credit system to into something the state can actually afford, rather than continue along with credits that the state has to delay paying.\r\nIn the new bill, companies would be expected to carry their losses until they are producing oil and owe a tax liability to the state &mdash; then they could use those losses to offset those taxes.\r\nA new addition to the bill cuts off a per-barrel credit given for oil production. But, it also drops the base tax rate for the North Slope by 10 percent.\r\nIf the oil industry investment in the state stays the same, and oil prices don&rsquo;t change dramatically, the Department of Revenue forecasts that the new oil tax credit system would raise oil income to the state for at least the next decade. &nbsp;According to its projections, the state could bring in $130 million more in revenue by 2019 all the way up to $475 million more by 2027.\r\nBut there are a lot of caveats to that projection, and the bill isn&rsquo;t assured to pass in its current form.\r\nOpponents and industry representatives have repeatedly argued that the state changes its oil tax credit regime too often.\r\nAlaska&rsquo;s Revenue commissioner Randall Hoffbeck said the political infighting and instability in the state&rsquo;s oil tax credit system go hand-in-hand.\r\n&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;ve got a state that&rsquo;s 50/50 split and a legislature that&rsquo;s 50/50 split on whether the current tax structure is an appropriate tax structure, there will always be a large amount of uncertainty in the underlying tax structure,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What we need to do is get to a tax structure that enough people say &lsquo;That is good enough. We&rsquo;re going to leave it alone and we&rsquo;re going to leave it alone for a long time.'&rdquo;\r\nHoffbeck said having a predictable tax system is more important than the actual amount of tax revenue the state brings in.\r\nOpponents also question the idea of raising taxes on the industry at a time when oil prices are low. The oil and gas industry has shed thousands of jobs since record high employment in 2015. And it&rsquo;s projected to lose another 1,500 this year.\r\nFairbanks Republican Steve Thompson said a tax hike will cause more people to lose their jobs.\r\n&ldquo;The oil companies have said they&rsquo;re going to be laying down drill rigs if this is what we&rsquo;re going to end up doing because we will not be profitable,&rdquo; Thompson said.\r\nBut many in the Democrat-led majority caucus said that industry will not walk away from Alaska citing other states and countries with higher tax rates and the state&rsquo;s high-quality oil.\r\nFairbanks Democrat David Guttenberg said Alaskans should look at what the multinational oil companies say about Alaska in their shareholder meetings. He says Prudhoe Bay will remain an attractive place to invest.\r\n&ldquo;Part of what they have successfully conveyed to this legislature, which has always bothered me, is that their shareholders are more important than our people,&rdquo; Guttenberg said.\r\nGuttenberg and 20 other legislators in the House are betting that the industry can handle the pressure. But, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of time left in the regular session for the Senate to decide what it&rsquo;s going to do. Next Sunday is the 90-day session deadline, but without a fiscal plan for the state or resolution on oil tax credits, lawmakers will likely continue to meet. Revision Use as is.

Don Young, R-Alaska, defended his bill that could give up to two million acres of the Tongass National Forest to the state of Alaska. U.S. Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, defended his bill that could give up to two million acres of the Tongass National Forest to the state of Alaska. U.S. Rep.&nbsp;Don Young, R-Alaska,&nbsp;defended his bill that could give up to two million acres of the Tongass National Forest to the state of Alaska.\r\nYoung was in Petersburg, a community that just passed a resolution opposing his legislation, on Monday.\r\nYoung told an audience in Petersburg that the municipality would not lose federal funding because of his bill and said he wouldn&rsquo;t run for re-election if it did.\r\nYoung&rsquo;s bill House Resolution&nbsp;232 would allow states to select or purchase up to two million acres of National Forest land for logging or other uses.\r\nPetersburg&rsquo;s borough assembly came out against that bill earlier this month, citing concerns over state management of the forest land, potential loss of federal funding and U.S. Forest Service jobs.\r\nYoung explained to a couple dozen residents why he&rsquo;s supporting the bill.\r\n&ldquo;The Tongass was not allowed to be selected lands when we became a state,&rdquo; Young said. &ldquo;We were allowed 103 million acres of land as a state, of our selection of lands that were not reserved at that time and the Tongass was reserved. So the only land you have are the communities themselves. There are no other lands. There&rsquo;s no opportunity of any other type of resources development and you have to have resources development, in time you will need it. So if you don&rsquo;t want it, if Petersburg doesn&rsquo;t want it, that&rsquo;s your business. But I am still going to push for two million acres of land in Southeast Alaska for the people in Southeast Alaska for the improvement of each of their communities.&rdquo;\r\nPetersburg receives Payment in Lieu of Taxes, or PILT payments, because the borough cannot collect property tax on the federal land.\r\nWithin the borough, 96 percent of the land is part of the national forest.\r\nThe borough in the past has also received payments for schools and road work, under the Secure Rural Schools Act. That program, passed by Congress in 2000, increased and stabilized the forest receipt payments that had once depended on federal revenue from timber sales and other economic activity on national forests.\r\nIt has meant hundreds of millions to rural communities near National Forests around the country. Both PILT payments and Secure Rural Schools need reauthorization by Congress to continue.\r\nYoung said his bill wouldn&rsquo;t impact those payments.\r\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to lose your PILT monies, you wont lose your Rural School monies if there&rsquo;s any monies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re gonna still maintain that. The whole thing was based on very frankly stumpage. We don&rsquo;t cut any more trees, so if they wanna save the trees then they oughta pay for it. And so I think your school funding, somewhat protected, maybe not increased but protected. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m predicting will happen. It&rsquo;s part of the program.&rdquo;\r\nBoth PILT and Secure Rural Schools payments are based on the amount of forest land in a borough. Audience members challenged Young on the point, questioning how Petersburg&rsquo;s federal payments could remain the same if there&rsquo;s less National Forest Land in Alaska.\r\n&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t lose any money,&rdquo; Young said. &ldquo;If you lose any money, if you lose any money from that selection, I won&rsquo;t run again. OK? That&rsquo;s how confident I am you&rsquo;re not losing any money.&rdquo;\r\nThe topic of federal funding came up for other programs.\r\nAudience members thanked him for his past support of funding for Essential Air Service, the Alaska Sea Grant Program and public broadcasting.\r\nThose programs would be eliminated under a budget proposed by President Donald Trump.\r\nYoung thinks Congress will approve a budget with those programs funded.\r\n&ldquo;Now in the lower 48 it has been abused,&rdquo; Young said of the Essential Air Service which pays airlines to provide stops in Alaska communities. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s people put in airports, some of the members of Congress put airports in their hometowns when there&rsquo;s only another airport 20 miles away.

The Alaska Department of Fish and Game is getting close to finalizing its study on mountain goat habitat in the Haines and Skagway area.\r\nBiologists hope the findings will inform decisions on helicopter skiing and other activities shown to impact mountain goats.\r\nLast fall, a Haines committee met several times to review and recommend changes to the borough&rsquo;s heliski boundaries map. After a lot of work, the committee&rsquo;s final product was cast aside because of conflict of interest concerns and wildlife studies like this one that are still in the works.\r\n&ldquo;Our study isn&rsquo;t designed to examine the effects of helicopter skiing or human activity on mountain goats,&rdquo; Fish and Game biologist Kevin White said at a recent presentation in Haines. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more oriented towards figuring out where important mountain goat winter habitat is and mapping that across the landscape and use that knowledge to help people who are making decisions about land management decide where appropriate places are for different types of activities.&rdquo;\r\nOver the past several years, biologists captured and put radio collars on 67 goats in the Haines/Skagway area.\r\nThey track the animals as they move along mountain ranges throughout the year. This, combined with aerial surveys, will help the researchers build a map that shows goats&rsquo; summer and winter habitat in the Northern Lynn Canal.\r\nOne of White and his colleagues&rsquo; discoveries has to do with where area mountain goats spend winters. Goats in coastal climates tend to winter at lower elevations. Their counterparts in interior climates winter at higher elevations. Haines has a transitional clime, so the goats are more unpredictable.\r\n&ldquo;We have a couple places like Takhin Ridge and the Kicking Horse that are complicated,&rdquo; White said. &ldquo;Where on average most of the animals are wintering below tree line, but then we have some animals that are wintering above. So we actually even see mixed wintering strategies within a given geography.&rdquo;\r\nThis variety of wintering patterns will be taken into account in the habitat map that comes out of the study.\r\nWhite gave examples of how the habitat map could be used with heliski maps. He said in some cases, there might be no overlap, or the heliski boundaries could be shifted slightly.\r\n&ldquo;But then it&rsquo;s not necessarily always that simple,&rsquo; White said.\r\nHe showed an example of winter goat habitat at high elevations in the Four Winds Mountain.\r\n&ldquo;In this case what might need to occur, if mountain goat conservation is the goal, would be to contract the area where helicopter skiing is allowed,&rdquo; White said. &ldquo;This would be a harder decision to make because it would be taking area off the map from helicopter skiing.&rdquo;\r\nThe chair of the most recent Haines heliski map committee, Ron Jackson, asked White whether&nbsp;he thinks the borough heliski map will have much overlap with goat habitat.\r\nWithout question, there are conflicts, White said.\r\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s going to be the hard challenge for the managers, is to decide how do you deal with that situation?&rdquo; he said.\r\nHaines is still deciding what process to follow with its next attempt to review heliski map boundaries. That&rsquo;s set to happen after Fish and Game finishes this study, which White said should be in a couple months.\r\nWhite also gave a big picture reason why people may want to make mountain goat conservation a priority: climate change.\r\nHe put together research that shows climate change will have a negative impact on goats because warm temperatures hurt their chances of survival.\r\nWhite said, best case scenario, Alaska goat populations decline. Worst case scenario, mountain goats in the state could go extinct within 70 years.

Snow pack in Feb. and March generally has almost no bearing on river breakup. The National Weather Service issued its annual river breakup forecast this week. The forecast calls for a relatively mild breakup arriving about on schedule across Alaska. But what factors determine the timing and severity how it plays out? We put that question to climatologist Brian Brettschneider.\r\nHe says snow pack in Feb. and March generally has almost no bearing on river breakup. Instead, it&rsquo;s closely correlated to temperatures in April and May.\r\n&ldquo;So we could have a warm winter up through then or a cold winter, all the way through March, but it really doesn&rsquo;t have much of an influence on what breakup is going to be like and when it&rsquo;s going to be,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You really need to focus on April and May temperatures and to a lesser degree what the snow conditions are like going into the month of April.&rdquo;\r\nSo, you could have the coldest winter on record, but a warmer-than-normal April will mean&nbsp;breakup happens fairly quickly. But you could also have a warm winter and a cold April, which would lead to a later breakup.\r\nBreakup is all about temperature.\r\n&ldquo;When we have sunny conditions and warm temperatures it thaws the ice and it also tends to melt whatever snow pack we have,&rdquo; Brettschneider said. &ldquo;So if we do have a thick snow pack, those warm temperatures can melt that snow quickly and send a rush of water into the streams&hellip;The temperature also drives the the snow melt, which can push the ice out of the way.\r\nBrettschneider hasn&rsquo;t used his understanding of spring breakup to play the Nanana Ice Classic, but he does have some forecasting tips:\r\n&ldquo;Historically, the best predictor of when river breakup is going to be, specifically with the Tanana river in Nenana, is to look at the calendar and look at last year to see when breakup is going to be. And that does better than any other kind of forecast technique.

A new bill that that is making its way through the state House, would require full disclosure of contamination on the deed of a property before it can be sold.\r\nThey&rsquo;re called environmental covenants and Alaska&nbsp;is one of just seven states that doesn&rsquo;t have laws on the books that make sure contamination is fully disclosed at the time of a property sale.\r\nKristin Ryan, the spill response director for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation has the perfect example of what can happen without environmental covenants: When a gas station in Anchorage closed and the owners pulled their tanks out of the ground, they found that fuel had leaked into the dirt around the foundation of a building on the property.&nbsp;The only way to clean up the dirt, was to remove the foundation of the building.\r\n&ldquo;So we agreed, and this is very common, we agreed to allow the responsible party to leave the dirt in place,&rdquo; Ryan said.\r\nThe state put a restriction on the property that said if the foundation was ever removed, the dirt would have to be cleaned up. But, then the site was sold several times. And two years ago another person bought the property.&nbsp;\r\nRyan says the new owner &ldquo;took the building down, was unaware of the restriction, spread the dirt everywhere and built a Subway restaurant.&rdquo;\r\nNow, the owner of the restaurant has to deal with clean-up on the property. A covenant could have changed that.&nbsp;\r\nThere are disclosure laws in Alaska already, but Ryan says that they aren&rsquo;t always followed. There&rsquo;s even an online database where the state keeps detailed logs of the types of contamination and cleanup efforts.\r\n&ldquo;So the information is out there for people, but who goes and looks at our database when they&rsquo;re buying property? I mean, it&rsquo;s not common,&rdquo; Ryan said. &ldquo;We talk to realtors and remind them to do that, and title companies and mortgage lenders, but it still isn&rsquo;t a guarantee that that information is communicated.&rdquo;\r\nThe new law would allow the state to put a covenant right on the deed of the property.\r\nRepublican Senate Majority leader Peter Micciche is carrying the bill this session. It&rsquo;s gotten broad bipartisan support so far, though Micciche says the title puts some people off at first.\r\n&ldquo;Some people in this building get concerned anytime they see the word environmental in something,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It takes a few minutes to explain the value. That, in this case, it&rsquo;s good for everyone.&rdquo;\r\nSo far, opposition to the bill has come primarily from the Department of Defense. The Air Force regional environmental office wrote to Micciche, saying it couldn&rsquo;t comply with the new law. There are federal laws that don&rsquo;t allow covenants to be placed on federal land.\r\nMicciche says he was expecting to hear from the federal government.\r\n&ldquo;We feel they should be held at the same standard,&rdquo; Micciche said. &ldquo;And we think it&rsquo;s important and as you can imagine in this building a note from the feds in opposition to a bill is not always a bad thing. And I don&rsquo;t say that lightly, it just happens to be the case.&rdquo;\r\nOther states that have enacted similar bills have found a way around the federal laws. Colorado put an environmental restriction clause in its environmental covenants bill. And Ryan says that it&rsquo;s a critical addition to Alaska&rsquo;s bill because most of the state&rsquo;s open contaminated sites are on federal property. &nbsp;\r\nThe bill sailed through its first House committee on Tuesday and is headed into another.\r\n&ldquo;The only roadblock that I see is time. I know of no opposition. It was 19-1 in the Senate. I expect it to be probably 40-zip in the house. It&rsquo;s a good bill,&rdquo; Micciche said.\r\nIt looks as though lawmakers will likely extend their stay in Juneau past their Sunday deadline. The environmental covenants bill has a hearing scheduled for Monday, after the conclusion of the 90-day regular session.

Ketchikan hosted the annual Alaska Wood Energy Conference last week, where participants heard about how biomass works in different places, and how to make the technology more known, and eventually less expensive to install and operate.\r\nBiomass is ancient.\r\nHumans have been burning wood to produce heat and light for thousands of years; but new technology has turned that ancient energy source into low-emission fuel that fits nicely on the menu of renewable energy options.\r\nUnlike wind and solar, for example, biomass doesn&rsquo;t get a lot of policy perks, which has slowed its growth.\r\nThat was a recurring theme of the 2017 wood energy conference &ndash; building policy.\r\nIn his presentation, Chris Rose of the Renewable Energy Alaska Project spent some time making the case for biomass: energy demand is on the rise, fossil fuels will run out, and renewable energy is a fast-growing industry that the United States &ndash; and Alaska &mdash; shouldn&rsquo;t miss out on.\r\nOne big reason is the potential cost savings.\r\n&ldquo;Alaskans are estimated to be using about $5 billion worth of energy every year,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So, if you collectively put together all the money that you and I put into transportation, heat and electricity: 730,000 people, we&rsquo;re spending $5 billion. Let&rsquo;s just say we can save 20 percent of that $5 billion. That&rsquo;s a billion dollars we&rsquo;re literally burning up every year.&rdquo;\r\nIn Alaska, though, Rose said state funding for biomass has dried up.\r\nTraditional banks don&rsquo;t like to invest in biomass, because they consider the technology too new, and therefore risky.\r\nRose suggests that the state establish a &ldquo;Green Bank,&rdquo; an independent state agency, kind of like the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, that attracts private investors for biomass projects by providing some guarantees for the loans.\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about not spending state money,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about leveraging state money and getting as much private money out of the markets as possible.&rdquo;\r\nThe model already exists, and Rose pointed to the Connecticut Green Bank as a success story.\r\nCanada already has taken a lead on encouraging biomass through policy. Several presenters from Canada talked about how that works for Alaska&rsquo;s closest neighbor.\r\nFernando Preto, a biomass researcher based out of British Columbia,&nbsp;said the Canadian federal government has specific policies in its proposed budget to support renewable and sustainable energy projects, including biomass, for the northern territories.\r\nThe total for those projects is about $300 million Canadian.\r\nThat huge swath of land is sparsely populated, even by Alaska standards, with small, isolated communities. And a large portion of the territories is treeless, too.\r\nSo, like Alaska, there&rsquo;s no one solution that will fit all the needs. They have to get creative, Preto said, and policies have to be flexible. It&rsquo;s worth the investment, though, because of the potential long-term economic benefits.\r\n&ldquo;If you have wood resources, you have local employment, you have local development, but much more important than that is the capacity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In some communities, especially in northern Ontario, they are at the capacity (or) near the capacity of their diesel generators. When they reach 75 percent of capacity, they go into a load restriction status. Any local industry is told you have to cut back on your power consumption.&rdquo;\r\nThat&rsquo;s not an attractive situation for industries exploring new locations.\r\nBlair Hogan of the Teslin Tlingit Council in the Yukon also spoke. While they have hydro for their electric needs, they were on diesel for heat. He said their new biomass heat system uses chipped waste wood harvested locally.\r\nHow did policy help them? Hogan said government grants were a major contributor. And with the new system, the community now has a source of local jobs and a way to reduce the area&rsquo;s wildfire risk.\r\nRyan Hennessy, senior energy planner with the provincial government of Yukon,&nbsp;said the government has a &ldquo;basket of policies&rdquo; to increase the viability of biomass.\r\nOne example is a policy to use biomass in public facilities and government buildings, which provides a large, steady customer for wood chips or pellets, thus supporting the industry.\r\n&ldquo;What went along with the biomass energy strategy was public consultation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This proved very important to us. We heard a lot of things both for and against biomass. People were broadly in favor of biomass energy.&rdquo;\r\nBut, he said, people also had concerns about the potential for overharvesting, and environmental problems related to emissions.\r\nSo, Hennessey said, they worked to calm concerns about timber supply and emissions &ndash; the newest technology provides a pretty clean burn &mdash; and they helped fund training within communities such as Teslin, teaching locals the various aspects of supplying and running a chip boiler.\r\nWashington and Oregon also have some established policies to encourage biomass.\r\nDylan Kruse of Portland-based Sustainable Northwest said one of the challenges for biomass is, right now, it&rsquo;s more expensive than natural gas. But, he said, policies can narrow that price gap through tax credits, like those that drive solar and wind-energy projects.\r\nThat would require people in the biomass industry to toot their own horns.\r\n&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do it as well; we&rsquo;re not as proud of it. But we should be. It&rsquo;s renewable; it&rsquo;s base-load power, that&rsquo;s very valuable to utilities,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got diverse outputs and distribution, whether it&rsquo;s electricity or heat or even transportation fuels. We can save money and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and it has a lot of other great ancillary benefits, like supporting forest stewardship and controlled waste disposal.&rdquo;\r\nThere are some federal programs in place that help, such as the U.S. Forest Service&rsquo;s wood energy grants.\r\nBut, Kruse predicts there will be less help on the federal side in coming years, so the focus should be on increasing and improving policies within individual states.\r\nKruse said the best way to encourage state policy is to talk with lawmakers and their staff, and to work with individual communities that are interested in biomass, so they, too, can lobby for state incentive policies.

Science story on climate change and human diets The foods we choose to put on our plates &mdash; or toss away &ndash; could have more of an ecological impact than many of us realize.\r\nOn Earth Day, here are some ways to consider how our diet impacts the planet.\r\nWaste not, want not\r\nYou&rsquo;ve heard the numbers on food waste. More than 30 percent of available food is tossed each year in America. It&rsquo;s enough to fill Chicago&rsquo;s 1,450-foot-tall Willis Tower (formerly known as the Sears Tower) 44 times over.\r\nThe U.S. has set an official goal to reduce food waste by 50 percent by the year 2030. Universities have begun to chip away at the food waste issue by promoting ugly fruit and vegetables and shifting away from pre-cooked, buffet style food, instead serving more cook-to-order options that can cut down on waste. Food service companies are working with farmers and chefs to get more blemished but edible produce into cafeterias across the country. Even religious groups are getting into the act, raising attention to the problem of food waste among the faithful and connecting with restaurants, retailers and food banks to help redirect food to hungry mouths that might otherwise end up in landfills.\r\nAnd there are a host of proposed solutions. Check out this report that highlights which solutions are likely to provide most bang for the buck. Among the most cost-effective strategies: educating consumers on food waste &ndash; including changes you can make in your own kitchen. (Here are some tips to get you started &ndash; like how to tell if eggs are still good past their expiration date.)\r\nRethink your beef and lamb habit\r\nEverything we eat has an environmental footprint &ndash; it takes land, water and energy to grow crops and raise livestock. The folks at the World Resources Institute have calculated the greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing a gram of edible protein of various foods.\r\nNot surprisingly, they found that foods such as beans, fish, nuts and egg have the lowest impact. Poultry, pork, milk and cheese have medium-sized impacts. By far, the biggest impacts, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, were linked to beef, lamb and goat. (As we&rsquo;ve reported, that&rsquo;s partly because the need for pastureland drives deforestation in places like the Brazilian Amazon.)\r\nWhy? According to WRI, beef uses 28 times more land per calorie consumed &mdash; and two to four times more freshwater &mdash; than the average of other livestock categories. What&rsquo;s more, cows are less efficient than other animals, like pigs and poultry, at converting feed into food.\r\nStill, telling people to go cold turkey with their red meat isn&rsquo;t likely to inspire real change. But this message might resonate: Even if you don&rsquo;t give up on red meat consumption entirely, just cutting back can significantly impact your diet&rsquo;s carbon footprint.\r\nAnd these days, there are lots of vegan substitutes &ndash; like plant burgers that sizzle, smell and even bleed like the real thing &mdash; that can deliver the meaty taste you crave as you try to scale back.\r\nKeep an eye out for more &lsquo;plant-based&rsquo; dishes on restaurant menus\r\nAs interest in plant-centric diets booms, new food businesses have taken root &ndash; from the veggie-centric fast-casual chains Beefsteak (from celebrity chef Jose Andres) and Chloe (an all-vegan restaurant) to the vegan meal-kit company Purple Carrot.\r\nNow, a new initiative from the World Resources Institute called the Better Buying Lab is bringing together big companies (including Panera Bread, Sodexo, Google, Unilever and Hilton) to develop and test strategies to nudge consumers towards choosing more sustainable foods. One initiative is to get more plant-based dishes onto menus.\r\n&ldquo;If you look at menus across the U.S., there tends to be [the same] 25 dishes that are on the majority of menus,&rdquo; says Daniel Vennard, director of the Better Buying Lab at WRI. Think burgers, chicken dishes, etc. &ldquo;Not many [plant-based] dishes have scaled to become national favorites,&rdquo; Vennard says.\r\nHis group is working to change that. It&rsquo;s teaming up with chefs from its member companies to create new recipes likely to have broad appeal. Promising ideas include the concept of &ldquo;superfood salads&rdquo; &mdash; containing combinations of nuts, seeds, greens, veggies and avocado.\r\nHe points to ideas already out there as well, such as burgers that blend meat and mushrooms. As we reported several years ago, some taste-testing has found that diners warmed up to the idea of blended burgers, and in fact many tasters preferred them to all-beef patties. And an ongoing competition from the James Beard Foundation has encouraged chefs around the country to give blended burgers a try on their menus. (Not everyone is a fan, though.)\r\n&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re trying to do is shift consumers towards eating more sustainable food, but we&rsquo;re not advocating for a no-meat diet,&rdquo; explains Vennard. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re saying, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s moderate.&rsquo; &rdquo; Ready Use as is.

At least, not so quickly.\r\n&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s documented this as basically occurring under our noses,&rdquo; Shugar said.\r\nDan Shugar researches how landforms evolve at the University of Washington in Tacoma.\r\nAnd last fall, he set out with his colleagues to study the Slims River. It&rsquo;s fed by a series of ponds at the front of the Kaskawulsh Glacier.\r\nWhen he arrived, Shugar says he expected the river&rsquo;s current to be low.\r\n&ldquo;But as it turned out is was essentially no flow,&rdquo; Shugar said. &ldquo;So we couldn&rsquo;t actually put our instruments in the water it was so shallow.&rdquo;\r\nShugar didn&rsquo;t spend the remainder of his time in Canada kicking back. His new mission became figuring out what happened to the Slims River.\r\nThe body of water used to flow into the Kluane Lake, and eventually into the Yukon River, which empties into the Bering Sea. But because of glacier melt, that water redirected.\r\n&ldquo;The Kaskawulsh River essentially stole all of that water that would have otherwise flowed into the Slims River,&rdquo; Shugar said. &ldquo;So it pirated that flow. It captured that flow.&rdquo;\r\nNow that water goes from the Kaskawulsh River to the Alsek River and all the way to the Gulf of Alaska.\r\nShugar says, due to the circumstances, this particular situation is unique. Still, the rapid pace at which it occurred serves as an important reminder.\r\n&ldquo;Climate change is happening and it&rsquo;s happening here,&rdquo; Shugar said. &ldquo;So we need to be keeping in mind that we may get thrown a few curve balls moving forward.&rdquo;\r\nSo while the Kaskawulsh River was the pirate, Shugar says human-caused climate change is ultimately to blame.

Xi said his visit would likely fuel a Chinese tourist boom in Alaska. Gov. Bill Walker hosted an unexpected guest on Friday &mdash; the President of China. Xi Jinping was headed back from a meeting with President Donald Trump in Florida.\r\nIt&rsquo;s not unusual for foreign leaders to re-fuel in Anchorage, but this wasn&rsquo;t just a pit stop. And experts say there are good reasons&nbsp;for China&rsquo;s top leader to drop in.\r\nShortly before 7:00 pm on Friday,&nbsp;Xi&nbsp;and his wife stepped off a 747 at Ted Stevens International Airport. President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s visit was a secret to most &mdash; Governor Bill Walker only found out two weeks in advance. But the governor offered a hearty welcome, with two of his grandchildren waiting on the tarmac with bouquets.\r\nAfter deplaning, Xi and the Chinese delegation headed South to Beluga Point, to gander at the snow-capped mountains across Turnagain Arm. The Seward highway was closed for about 30 minutes to accommodate the visit &mdash; which came just a day after the same road was closed for 12 hours for a police manhunt and an unplanned avalanche.\r\nThen Xi and his delegation returned to downtown Anchorage, strolling into a conference room on the bottom floor of the Hotel Captain Cook. Sounds of the Anchorage Rotary Club&rsquo;s 100th Anniversary celebration emanated faintly from the ceiling as Walker and the president of China grinned, shook hands and sat down to talk.\r\nWalker talked about the state&rsquo;s seafood industry &mdash; of which China is a top importer, Native corporations and Alaska&rsquo;s position as a major air cargo hub.\r\nBut the governor devoted the bulk of his public remarks to his favorite megaproject: a planned natural gas pipeline from the North Slope to Nikiski.\r\n&ldquo;Through the development of an 800-mile pipeline and liquefied natural gas facility, Alaska can provide a stable source of gas supply to the Asia-Pacific region for more than a century,&rdquo; Walker said.\r\nPresident Xi&rsquo;s public remarks were more focused on the views.\r\n&ldquo;In the eyes of ours and in the eyes of many of the Chinese people, Alaska is a land that brings a lot of mystery in our mind,&rdquo; Xi said through an interpreter. &ldquo;It is where the people would like to go. It&rsquo;s like Shangri-La to us.&rdquo;\r\nThe Chinese president then made a prediction:&nbsp;&ldquo;The very fact that we have now been here, I believe, will serve as a good advertisement for your state.&rdquo;\r\nXi said his visit would likely fuel a Chinese tourist boom in Alaska.\r\nBut while the press was present&nbsp;for all of Governor Walker&rsquo;s remarks, the bulk of Xi&rsquo;s statement happened behind closed doors &mdash; in polite whispers, Chinese security guards ushered reporters out of the room. Neither leader took any questions.\r\nBefore taking off around 11 pm Friday, Xi and his delegation dined with Walker and his staff on king salmon and crab bisque.\r\nAt a press conference the next morning, Walker described the meeting as &ldquo;very special&rdquo; &mdash; although the Chinese president may have been disappointed by the restaurant&rsquo;s stationary nature.\r\n&ldquo;When we sat down to have dinner at the Captain Cook we were facing the mountains,&rdquo; said Walker. &ldquo;And he asked if the room would spin&nbsp;&mdash; [would]&nbsp;be turning around. And I said I hoped it wouldn&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;\r\nWalker said the discussion covered everything from climate change to the natural gas line to training opportunities for Chinese winter Olympic athletes. The governor didn&rsquo;t announce any new initiatives, but said he felt the visit could lead to closer ties.\r\n&ldquo;If we had traveled to China, we could not have had a meeting like this; not be surrounded with this level of high level ministers at that meeting,&rdquo; said Walker. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to say it was a little unprecedented.&rdquo;\r\nExperts say the Chinese president&rsquo;s Anchorage excursion was probably more than just a chance to eat salmon with the governor.\r\n&ldquo;It makes a lot of sense for them to strengthen their relationship with Alaska,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Nils Andreassen of the Institute of the North, an Arctic research group in Anchorage.\r\nAndreassen said&nbsp;China has a strong interest in Arctic issues, focusing heavily on research and diplomacy in this area. They&rsquo;re especially interested in the prospect of Arctic&nbsp;shipping routes, Andreassen said.\r\nBut, he added, there was probably another reason for the visit: &ldquo;Because Anchorage is beautiful.&rdquo;\r\nAndreassen said China is keenly interested in expanding tourism opportunities here.&nbsp;So get ready, Alaska &mdash; Xi was probably dead serious when he said to expect a lot more Chinese tourists headed our way.

After months of delay, the Pebble Limited Partnership was granted Tuesday its land use permit by the state&rsquo;s Department of Natural Resources.\r\nBut taking into account the concerns raised through a public comment period, DNR is adding more oversight to Pebble&rsquo;s activities and adding some new stipulations to the permit.\r\nAlaska&rsquo;s Department of Natural Resources grants the miscellaneous land use permit needed by companies like Pebble to operate on state lands. This one was different than the rest of the thousands processed annually.\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very unique process,&rdquo; commissioner Andy Mack said Tuesday. &ldquo;A lot of what of we have done is new, including the requirement that a permit application like the one that we saw from Pebble would be subject to a public comment period.&rdquo;\r\nThat followed a lawsuit challenge brought by Nunamta Aulukestai, which made its way to the Alaska Supreme Court. The result was an opportunity for the public to weigh in on Pebble&rsquo;s state land use permit requests.\r\nLast fall DNR took in more than 2,000 comments on this application, and Mack said staff took them very seriously.\r\n&ldquo;Many of them were substantive, many of them were Alaskan, and many of them were from the Bristol Bay region,&rdquo; Mack said.\r\nMany also alleged Pebble left a mess at some past exploratory drill sites and that state regulators have not been stringent enough.\r\nDNR does not necessarily agree with that assessment.\r\n&ldquo;One of the central points that was raised as a matter of concern was the status of approximately 80 sites that were reviewed by (Center of Science in Public Participation),&rdquo; DNR wrote in it&rsquo;s report. &ldquo;Upon review of the CSP2 report, in consultation with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, the department was unable to conclude there is clear evidence of permit violation, but agreed these concerns should be reviewed on site.&rdquo;\r\nThe state agreed to public requests for more site inspections, and added a $2 million bonding requirement for cleanup in the event Pebble folds. The length of the requested permit also was shortened to one year.\r\n&ldquo;Miscellaneous Land Use Permits, or MLUPs, can be issued for as little as one year or for as long as five years,&rdquo; Mack said. &ldquo;Based on the amount of interest, and based on the need in our minds to be more proactive and get into the field and be looking at some of the concerns being raised, we issued this permit for one year.&rdquo;\r\nGroups opposed to Pebble say they did not get everything they were hoping for, including a request that the company be required to close any old boreholes no longer in use. But they did cheer the administration for the other changes the state put in place.\r\n&ldquo;This is really the state holding Pebble to a tighter standard, which they should,&rdquo; said Kim Williams, the executive director of Nunamta Aulukestai.\r\nWilliams, the United Tribes of Bristol Bay and others have voiced concern about a perceived prior lack of state oversight and &ldquo;rubber stamping&rdquo; of permits for the controversial project.\r\n&ldquo;Our state hasn&rsquo;t, I believe, held them to a standard of watching them, inspecting them, and making sure that they go back in and close things up,&rdquo; said Williams. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s good for us.&rdquo;\r\nFor three summers, Pebble has done little but &ldquo;care and maintenance&rdquo; of their mining claims. Of the more than 1,300 old boreholes, 80 were identified as problematic by the independent inspection paid for by the United Tribes of Bristol Bay.\r\nPebble also disagrees with the findings of that report, which were a primary theme of the public comments.\r\n&ldquo;Many of the issues that were raised in the public comment window we take great exception to primarily because the technical foundation for it was not very strong,&rdquo; Pebble spokesman Mike Heatwole said Tuesday. &ldquo;We firmly believe that we&rsquo;re in compliance with the terms and conditions for the permit to operate out there. Our work is sound, we take our responsibility very seriously and will continue to do so.&rdquo;\r\nHeatwole said the company has already put up the $2 million performance guaranty now required by DNR and would welcome the added state inspections.\r\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking forward to getting our summer work program on track, and we&rsquo;re committed to continuing to run a compliant operation,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;More than anything it&rsquo;s good to have a permit in hand and ready to move forward.&rdquo;\r\nThe permit issued Tuesday by the state does not authorize any new exploration at the Pebble claims, nor has the company yet requested that.\r\nHowever, in a news&nbsp;release issued Tuesday, CEO Tom Collier confirmed &ldquo;Pebble will be advancing a program of work in Alaska in 2017 to prepare the project to initiate permitting under the Clean Water Act and National Environmental Policy Act.&rdquo; Ready Use as is.

Hilcorp is moving ahead with the only offshore drilling project currently planned in federal Arctic waters. Last week, Hilcorp was finally able to fix a fuel line in Cook Inlet that regulators say started leaking gas in December. But the oil and gas company and its allies are still struggling to contain another issue: environmental groups, which argue that Hilcorp&rsquo;s problems in Cook Inlet disqualify the company from drilling for oil in the Arctic Ocean.\r\nEarlier this month, Lois Epstein of the Wilderness Society in Anchorage wrote an op-ed in the Alaska Dispatch News. Epstein&rsquo;s headline read: &ldquo;Hilcorp&rsquo;s Cook Inlet leaks underscore Arctic risks.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I certainly have, and I know others have, enormous concerns about Hilcorp being the operator of this new operation in the Arctic,&rdquo; Epstein said in an interview. &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s a company that doesn&rsquo;t appear to have a strong handle on its operations.&rdquo;\r\nEpstein noted that Hilcorp&rsquo;s gas leak in Cook Inlet took months to fix, as dangerous ice conditions prevented divers from getting to the pipeline. The company also had to shut down two other pipelines in the Inlet this spring due to suspected leaks. Epstein said the incidents raise questions about a project the company is pursuing hundreds of miles to the north.\r\nHilcorp is moving ahead with the only offshore drilling project currently planned in federal Arctic waters. It&rsquo;s called Liberty. Hilcorp wants to build a gravel island in shallow waters about six miles from the Beaufort Sea coast. According to plans submitted to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the oil would flow to shore via a buried subsea pipeline.\r\nEpstein said&nbsp;that Hilcorp&rsquo;s gas leak in Cook Inlet was hard to fix &mdash; and repairing a pipe or cleaning up an oil spill in Arctic waters would be a lot harder.\r\n&ldquo;You do have lots of other challenges in the Arctic,&rdquo; said Epstein. &ldquo;You have storms, you have certainly cold, you have remoteness, you have the inability to respond very quickly because you don&rsquo;t have the people power and the infrastructure.&rdquo;\r\nA growing number of national environmental groups agree with Epstein &mdash; including the Center for Biological Diversity and Greenpeace. They&rsquo;re calling for the federal government to scrutinize Hilcorp&rsquo;s safety record before approving the Liberty Project. And as President Donald Trump weighs an executive order to step back the Obama administration&rsquo;s five-year moratorium on Arctic drilling, some groups argue the gas leak shows oil development in the Arctic shouldn&rsquo;t happen at all.\r\nBut the pushback from the oil industry has come hard and fast.\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nonsensical; it makes no sense to say, &lsquo;because we had a leak over here means they will never be able to respond to a leak in the Arctic.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s just a fabrication,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Kara Moriarty, who leads the Alaska Oil and Gas Association.\r\nMoriarty wrote her own op-ed in the Alaska Dispatch News. It was just one of a wave of opinion pieces condemning environmental groups&rsquo; arguments, which appeared in both local and national media.\r\nMoriarty argued recent incidents involving Hilcorp don&rsquo;t mean the company can&rsquo;t operate safely in the Arctic.\r\n&ldquo;When something happens, the company responds, they change their behavior, they pay their fine, and they change their process &mdash; that&rsquo;s why you have regulatory oversight,&rdquo; said Moriarty. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not to say, &lsquo;oh, a company did something and we fined them, and and now they shouldn&rsquo;t do anything else in Alaska again.'&rdquo;\r\nHilcorp didn&rsquo;t agree to an interview for this story, but in an emailed statement, Hilcorp&rsquo;s Alaska Senior Vice President David Wilkins said the Liberty project is &ldquo;vastly different&rdquo; from its operations in Cook Inlet. However, Wilkins&nbsp;noted Liberty&nbsp;is similar to two other projects Hilcorp is already operating in state waters in the Arctic, called the Endicott project and the Northstar project.\r\n&ldquo;We are dedicated to safe and responsible operations with every project, every day,&rdquo; Wilkins wrote in the email.\r\nThe federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is currently working through the environmental review process for the Liberty project. The agency expects to begin a 60-day public comment period this summer.\r\nAnd despite the oil industry&rsquo;s objections, environmental groups are sure to bring up the Cook Inlet gas leak when arguing Hilcorp shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to drill in the Arctic.

After hours of debate on the state House floor, an oil tax credit bill is on its way to the Senate.\r\nHouse Bill 111 passed, primarily along caucus lines. Proponents said that it will stabilize the state&rsquo;s tax regime and get Alaska a larger share of the profits from its oil.\r\nOpponents said they were rushed in reviewing the latest version of the bill. &nbsp;And, they say that increasing taxes on oil industry when prices are down will drive away the industry Alaska relies on for most of its money.\r\nvolume.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alaska is one step closer to getting another oil tax credit overhaul. Representatives in the State House voted to send a contentious bill over to the Senate.\r\nFacing stiff opposition to a tax hike from Senate Republicans, the House Finance committee that put out the latest version of the bill tied it to a Senate-approved permanent fund bill. They added language that said the permanent fund bill will only pass in the House if the House&rsquo;s version of the oil tax credit bill passes in the Senate.\r\nThe latest oil tax credit overhaul drew a lot of criticism from opponents in the House who said that it goes beyond fixing a cash-for-credit system that many said the state cannot afford.\r\nWasilla Republican Delena Johnson and many of her colleagues in the House minority said they did not have enough time to look over the newest version of the bill. It was put out on Friday.\r\n&ldquo;To take on this bill without understanding the consequence. Having it sneaked in at the last minute, having less than 12 hours to put in amendments, it just doesn&rsquo;t make good sense,&rdquo; she said.\r\nIn its current form, the bill drops a program that offered&nbsp;tax credits that can be transferred to other companies or exchanged for cash for work done on the North Slope.

After hours of debate on the state House floor, an oil tax credit bill is on its way to the Senate.\r\nHouse Bill 111 passed, primarily along caucus lines. Proponents said that it will stabilize the state&rsquo;s tax regime and get Alaska a larger share of the profits from its oil.\r\nOpponents said they were rushed in reviewing the latest version of the bill. &nbsp;And, they say that increasing taxes on oil industry when prices are down will drive away the industry Alaska relies on for most of its money.\r\nvolume.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alaska is one step closer to getting another oil tax credit overhaul. Representatives in the State House voted to send a contentious bill over to the Senate.\r\nFacing stiff opposition to a tax hike from Senate Republicans, the House Finance committee that put out the latest version of the bill tied it to a Senate-approved permanent fund bill. They added language that said the permanent fund bill will only pass in the House if the House&rsquo;s version of the oil tax credit bill passes in the Senate.\r\nThe latest oil tax credit overhaul drew a lot of criticism from opponents in the House who said that it goes beyond fixing a cash-for-credit system that many said the state cannot afford.\r\nWasilla Republican Delena Johnson and many of her colleagues in the House minority said they did not have enough time to look over the newest version of the bill. It was put out on Friday.\r\n&ldquo;To take on this bill without understanding the consequence. Having it sneaked in at the last minute, having less than 12 hours to put in amendments, it just doesn&rsquo;t make good sense,&rdquo; she said.\r\nIn its current form, the bill drops a program that offered&nbsp;tax credits that can be transferred to other companies or exchanged for cash for work done on the North Slope.

Web recap with 1 pic Secretary of State Rex Tillerson got an earful from governments around the Arctic today &mdash; on the topic of climate change.\r\nTillerson was in Fairbanks to chair a meeting of the Arctic Council, which brings together nations and indigenous groups from around the region. The U.S. was formally handing over the rotating chairmanship to Finland.\r\nThe Arctic Council takes a keen interest in climate change, and it&rsquo;s waiting to see how the Trump administration will handle the issue &ndash; and whether the U.S. will withdraw from the international Paris climate accord.\r\nTillerson tackled the issue head-on during his opening statement.\r\n&ldquo;We are appreciative that each of you has an important point of view,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And you should know that we are taking the time to understand your concerns. We&rsquo;re not going to rush to make a decision, we&rsquo;re going to work to make the right decision for the United States.&rdquo;\r\nThe Trump administration has indicated it will decide whether to remain in the Paris agreement within weeks.\r\nMany of Tillerson&rsquo;s counterparts took the opportunity to press for action, including&nbsp;Swedish foreign minister Margot Elisabeth Wallstr&ouml;m, who asked&nbsp;what the planet say if it had a seat at the table.\r\n&ldquo;Perhaps our planet would say, I&rsquo;ve been your best friend since the industrial revolution,&rdquo; Wallstr&ouml;m said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done everything I can to dampen and absorb. I&rsquo;ve tried to keep Greenland and the permafrost in Siberia intact. And I have sent you no invoices. But it is about to change.&rdquo;\r\nThat point was made over and over again. Each Arctic nation and indigenous group had three minutes to speak and hardly any let the chance pass without mentioning climate change.\r\nThe Gwich&rsquo;in Council International declared, without coordinated action, &ldquo;our culture cannot survive.&rdquo; Finland, the incoming chair, called global warming &ldquo;the main engine of change&rdquo; in the region.\r\nMichael Sfraga is with the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. He says the emphasis was notable.\r\n&ldquo;It was not lost on anyone that the emphasis on climate change was there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And of course messaging to the administration in this country, I believe, that the other seven have recognized the importance of the Paris agreement. And I don&rsquo;t think they were shy about underscoring their commitment to recognizing and dealing with climate change.&rdquo;\r\nThat message is also clear in the joint statement released by the Council after the meeting, called the Fairbanks Declaration.\r\nThe Declaration, approved by the entire Council, included strong language on the impacts of climate change in the Arctic &ndash; acknowledging the Paris climate agreement and calling for global action.\r\nThe Council also adopted the third binding agreement in its 20-year history &mdash; to improve scientific cooperation.

Recap of new report on sea ice loss The latest research shows that diminishing Arctic sea ice caused by climate change is forcing some species to travel further to find food or look for alternative food sources.\r\n&ldquo;Polar bears are even showing up on murre colonies. Now, these are cliff-nesting birds,&rdquo; said Kathy Kuletz, a bird researcher with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, referring to one notable example.\r\nKuletz&rsquo;s research is part of a new report on Arctic marine biodiversity published by the Arctic Council in conjunction with their ministerial meeting in Fairbanks May 10-11. It describes how melting of the Arctic sea ice also is forcing marine species to shift their ranges further north. It also notes that increasing numbers of southern species are moving into Arctic waters, and it describes an increasing frequency in contagious diseases like avian cholera.\r\nIn a video version of the report produced by the Arctic Council, Haakon Hop of the Norwegian Polar Institute said the rapid reduction of thicker multi-year and second-year ice is having a dramatic impact on the Arctic sea ice ecosystem.\r\n&ldquo;Things are happening very fast. I don&rsquo;t think most people realize how fast climate warming is affecting Arctic sea ice and the sea ice ecosystem,&rdquo; Hop said. &ldquo;I never thought I would see it in my quite short lifetime as a researcher. But I think I will see an ice-free Arctic Ocean before I&rsquo;m done with my research career.&rdquo;\r\nReduction in sea ice means changes for beluga whale migration. It also creates problems for harp seals, bearded seals and ringed seals when they have their pups or try to raise them. Walrus will haul out on shore rather than on sea ice, increasing calf mortality from possible stampedes and forcing adults to travel further to find food.\r\nKit Kovacs of the Norwegian Polar Institute remembers how the sea ice around the Svalbard Archipelago is dramatically different from just 12&nbsp;years ago.\r\n&ldquo;Just suddenly, unpredicted, unprecedented collapse in sea ice,&rdquo; Kovacs said. &ldquo;And, it really hasn&rsquo;t recovered.&rdquo;\r\nThe absence of sea ice has affected how scientists observe or survey various species.\r\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing profound changes, many of which are quite difficult to document because the traditional tools available to us like flying surveys at molting to count seals on sea ice are obviously no longer possible without sea ice,&rdquo; Kovacs said.\r\nKovacs said they&rsquo;re observing behavioral changes. Seals, for example, have to travel further to find food, dive deeper and for a longer period of time, and are resting less.\r\n&ldquo;All of which means, of course, it costs much more to get the food that you require,&rdquo; Kovacs said. &ldquo;That will eventually have reproductive consequences and growth consequences for these animals. You see that kind of phenomenon in many different species right now.&rdquo;\r\nPolar bears usually hunt seals on the sea ice.\r\nBut Kathy Kuletz of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said polar bears have been observed foraging for food by going after ground-nesting common eiders or cliff-nesting murres.\r\n&ldquo;When the bears show up, they disturb the birds, the birds fly off,&rdquo; Kuletz said. &ldquo;That not only means that the bears are going after the chicks and eggs that they can get on the cliffs, but when the adult birds leave, because they&rsquo;ve been startled by the bear, the other predators like gulls will come in and attack the eggs and chicks. It&rsquo;s not just what the bears eat, but the disruption in the colony, as well.&rdquo;\r\nConnie Lovejoy of Quebec&rsquo;s Universit&eacute; Laval said they can no longer take data from a particular event and extrapolate to the entire Arctic. For example, higher ocean temperatures may prompt an increase in small, warm water plankton called copepods in one region of the Arctic and an increase of fattier, cold water copepods on the opposite side of the Arctic.\r\n&ldquo;My big worry is really that by simplifying the system and not having enough data, those nuances, those small differences regionally, they&rsquo;re lost,&rdquo; Lovejoy said. &ldquo;If you want to have local communities able to exploit their resources in the Arctic, they actually need to have a more accurate picture of what the future of their region is going to look like because there is no one Arctic.&rdquo;\r\nWhile some countries continuously monitor certain species, other countries may only do research that coincides with specific, short-term projects.\r\nThe 200-page report on Arctic marine biodiversity was produced by the Arctic Council&rsquo;s Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna working group. It incorporates the work of 60&nbsp;scientists from around the world, including three researchers from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\r\n&nbsp; Ready Use as is.

Continuing coverage Since yesterday,&nbsp;nineteen new fires have started west of the Yukon River in the Galena zone, an area of about 93 million acres. These latest blazes raise the current number of active wildfires in Alaska to about 50.\r\nBeth Ipsen is the spokesperson for Bureau of Land Management&rsquo;s Alaska Fire Service. Ipsen says these fires extend from Southwestern Alaska to the North Slope.\r\n&ldquo;Many of these fires were discovered along the Western coast from Unalakleet to Point Romanof. When Galena sent out an aircraft to fly, it&rsquo;s called a detection flight,&rdquo; explained Ipsen. &ldquo;So, when we get a rash of lightning that runs through an area and it&rsquo;s not accompanied by a lot of rain, then they&rsquo;ll fly the area to see if there&rsquo;s any new wildfires.&rdquo;\r\nIn order to combat 49 currently active wildfires throughout the State, additional smokejumpers and firefighting resources are coming up from the lower 48. Ipsen says around 20 smokejumpers from Boise, Idaho should be in Alaska sometime today.\r\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re also bringing in some of the type-2, emergency firefighter village crews,&rdquo; said Ipsen. &ldquo;I know that we should have one from Grayling that will be going out to the Deadman&rsquo;s Slough fire near Anvik in the next day or two.&rdquo;\r\nLess than three miles away from Anvik, the Deadman&rsquo;s Slough fire has spread to around 420 acres since Monday. Ipsen says the crew fighting this fire has increased in number and has contained 30% of the fire.\r\n&ldquo;We have 33 people on the fire right now, including the eight smoke jumpers and the Interagency hot shot crew that are concentrating on making sure that it doesn&rsquo;t get to the village. But, now, they are also focusing on putting the fire out,&rdquo; Ipsen stated.\r\nThe&nbsp;National Weather Service has removed the red flag warnings from its website; however, Ipsen says there is still strong potential for more fires to start in these conditions.\r\n&ldquo;For Interior Alaska, the conditions are near red flag conditions but not quite, but that could always change. And usually, what red flag criteria is, you have to have temperatures of at least 75 degrees, a relative humidity factor of 25% or lower, and sustained winds of at least 15mph. So if you have all three of those at the same time, that&rsquo;s when you have your red flag conditions.&rdquo; Ipsen continued, &ldquo;You can have near red flag conditions if one of those is just a little bit under.&rdquo;\r\nAccording to Ipsen, no injuries or building damages have been reported as a result of the fires in the Galena zone or the Deadman&rsquo;s Slough fire. It is unknown as to when these fires will be put out. Ready Use as needed. More to come.

But these big black letters were spray-painted on the outside of the bunker &mdash; not hidden inside like most graffiti.</p>\r\n<p>Dane snapped a photo of the tag, posted it on Facebook, and watched as the comments poured in.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I got a lot of angry people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not at me, but a lot of them were angry toward the supposed people who wrote it on there.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>No one&rsquo;s really sure who tagged the bunker, but the graffiti provides some clues.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It felt like a punch in the gut when you see it has a U.S. Coast Guard tag on it,&rdquo; said Carlin Enlow, director of the Unalaska Convention and Visitors Bureau.</p>\r\n<p>She saw the photo online and drew the same conclusion as a lot of commenters &mdash; that the bunker was defaced by crew members of the Coast Guard Cutter Morgenthau, designated number 722.</p>\r\n<p>For years, the cutter has stopped in Unalaska on patrol in the Bering Sea, protecting marine resources and helping with search and rescue.</p>\r\n<p>For Enlow, that mission makes the tag even harder to stomach.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a group of people who are supposed to serve and protect us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All these questions come to mind. Obviously, why? Why would you do that?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Morgenthau&rsquo;s commanding officer looked into the matter after KUCB requested comment.</p>\r\n<p>The extent of the Coast Guard&rsquo;s investigation is unclear, but officials say there&rsquo;s &ldquo;no information available&rdquo; to confirm if crew members are responsible.</p>\r\n<p>In the past, the landowning company has given Coast Guard crews permission to paint the names and numbers of their vessels on blast shields decorating the side of Mount Ballyhoo, where the military stashed munitions during the war.</p>\r\n<p>Ounalashka Corporation CEO Chris Salts said the native corporation has always had a good relationship with the Coast Guard, and he&rsquo;s not up in arms over this new piece of graffiti. But he said the corporation will pay to have the bunker cleaned this summer to preserve the area&rsquo;s historical integrity.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the Coast Guard announced Monday that the Morgenthau is being decommissioned after nearly 50 years of service.</p>\r\n<p>The State Department is taking control of the cutter and may grant it to a friendly foreign government under the Foreign Assistance Act.</p>\r\n<p>Officials say other vessels will take over the Morgenthau&rsquo;s mission in the Bering Sea.</p>", "original_webfacet": true, "github_link": "", "pushed_to_wp": false, "history_date": "2017-04-23T08:10:00.827Z", "share_note": "Use as needed.", "wf_description": "Unalaska residents are angry over graffiti on a historical military bunker.", "organization": 2}, "model": "editorial.historicalwebfacet", "pk": 9}, {"fields": {"code": "", "excerpt": "A Cessna 182E Skylane crashed Saturday afternoon near Mile 90 of the Parks Highway.", "creation_date": "2017-04-23T08:51:29.478Z", "keywords": "[\"Parks Highway\", \" Cessna\", \" Alaska State Troopers\"]", "owner": 2, "captions": "", "id": 7, "story": 3, "history_type": "+", "run_date": "2017-04-23T19:00:00Z", "title": "Small aircraft crashes near Mile 90 of Parks Highway", "discussion": 27, "editor": 2, "due_edit": "2017-04-23T13:00:00Z", "history_user": 2, "status": "In Progress", "wf_content": "<p>A Cessna 182E Skylane crashed Saturday afternoon near Mile 90 of the Parks Highway.</p>\r\n<p>Emergency crews responded about&nbsp;4 p.m. to a crashed aircraft, including Alaska State Troopers and personnel from multiple EMS divisions in the Upper Valley.</p>\r\n<p>The fixed wing, single-engine aircraft is registered to Robert Hill of Naknek, Alaska, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>\r\n<p>The pilot, later identified by Alaska State Troopers as Ronald Scott Hernandez,&nbsp;51, of King Salmon,&nbsp;was transported from the scene of the crash to Mat-Su Regional Medical Center, Palmer, by ambulance, and was reportedly conscious at the time he was taken from the scene.</p>\r\n<p>Hernandez suffered minor injuries, troopers said.</p>\r\n<p>The crash caused a power loss to about 2,600 customers, Matanuska Electric Association Inc. confirmed.

But, it also drops the base tax rate for the North Slope by 10 percent.</p>\r\n<p>If the oil industry investment in the state stays the same, and oil prices don&rsquo;t change dramatically, the Department of Revenue forecasts that the new oil tax credit system would raise oil income to the state for at least the next decade. &nbsp;According to its projections, the state could bring in $130 million more in revenue by 2019 all the way up to $475 million more by 2027.</p>\r\n<p>But there are a lot of caveats to that projection, and the bill isn&rsquo;t assured to pass in its current form.</p>\r\n<p>Opponents and industry representatives have repeatedly argued that the state changes its oil tax credit regime too often.</p>\r\n<p>Alaska&rsquo;s Revenue commissioner Randall Hoffbeck said the political infighting and instability in the state&rsquo;s oil tax credit system go hand-in-hand.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;ve got a state that&rsquo;s 50/50 split and a legislature that&rsquo;s 50/50 split on whether the current tax structure is an appropriate tax structure, there will always be a large amount of uncertainty in the underlying tax structure,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What we need to do is get to a tax structure that enough people say &lsquo;That is good enough. We&rsquo;re going to leave it alone and we&rsquo;re going to leave it alone for a long time.'&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Hoffbeck said having a predictable tax system is more important than the actual amount of tax revenue the state brings in.</p>\r\n<p>Opponents also question the idea of raising taxes on the industry at a time when oil prices are low. The oil and gas industry has shed thousands of jobs since record high employment in 2015. And it&rsquo;s projected to lose another 1,500 this year.</p>\r\n<p>Fairbanks Republican Steve Thompson said a tax hike will cause more people to lose their jobs.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The oil companies have said they&rsquo;re going to be laying down drill rigs if this is what we&rsquo;re going to end up doing because we will not be profitable,&rdquo; Thompson said.</p>\r\n<p>But many in the Democrat-led majority caucus said that industry will not walk away from Alaska citing other states and countries with higher tax rates and the state&rsquo;s high-quality oil.</p>\r\n<p>Fairbanks Democrat David Guttenberg said Alaskans should look at what the multinational oil companies say about Alaska in their shareholder meetings. He says Prudhoe Bay will remain an attractive place to invest.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Part of what they have successfully conveyed to this legislature, which has always bothered me, is that their shareholders are more important than our people,&rdquo; Guttenberg said.</p>\r\n<p>Guttenberg and 20 other legislators in the House are betting that the industry can handle the pressure. But, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of time left in the regular session for the Senate to decide what it&rsquo;s going to do.

But, it also drops the base tax rate for the North Slope by 10 percent.</p>\r\n<p>If the oil industry investment in the state stays the same, and oil prices don&rsquo;t change dramatically, the Department of Revenue forecasts that the new oil tax credit system would raise oil income to the state for at least the next decade. &nbsp;According to its projections, the state could bring in $130 million more in revenue by 2019 all the way up to $475 million more by 2027.</p>\r\n<p>But there are a lot of caveats to that projection, and the bill isn&rsquo;t assured to pass in its current form.</p>\r\n<p>Opponents and industry representatives have repeatedly argued that the state changes its oil tax credit regime too often.</p>\r\n<p>Alaska&rsquo;s Revenue commissioner Randall Hoffbeck said the political infighting and instability in the state&rsquo;s oil tax credit system go hand-in-hand.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;ve got a state that&rsquo;s 50/50 split and a legislature that&rsquo;s 50/50 split on whether the current tax structure is an appropriate tax structure, there will always be a large amount of uncertainty in the underlying tax structure,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What we need to do is get to a tax structure that enough people say &lsquo;That is good enough. We&rsquo;re going to leave it alone and we&rsquo;re going to leave it alone for a long time.'&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Hoffbeck said having a predictable tax system is more important than the actual amount of tax revenue the state brings in.</p>\r\n<p>Opponents also question the idea of raising taxes on the industry at a time when oil prices are low. The oil and gas industry has shed thousands of jobs since record high employment in 2015. And it&rsquo;s projected to lose another 1,500 this year.</p>\r\n<p>Fairbanks Republican Steve Thompson said a tax hike will cause more people to lose their jobs.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The oil companies have said they&rsquo;re going to be laying down drill rigs if this is what we&rsquo;re going to end up doing because we will not be profitable,&rdquo; Thompson said.</p>\r\n<p>But many in the Democrat-led majority caucus said that industry will not walk away from Alaska citing other states and countries with higher tax rates and the state&rsquo;s high-quality oil.</p>\r\n<p>Fairbanks Democrat David Guttenberg said Alaskans should look at what the multinational oil companies say about Alaska in their shareholder meetings. He says Prudhoe Bay will remain an attractive place to invest.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Part of what they have successfully conveyed to this legislature, which has always bothered me, is that their shareholders are more important than our people,&rdquo; Guttenberg said.</p>\r\n<p>Guttenberg and 20 other legislators in the House are betting that the industry can handle the pressure. But, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of time left in the regular session for the Senate to decide what it&rsquo;s going to do. Next Sunday is the 90-day session deadline, but without a fiscal plan for the state or resolution on oil tax credits, lawmakers will likely continue to meet.</p>", "original_webfacet": true, "github_link": "", "pushed_to_wp": false, "history_date": "2017-04-23T09:41:29.755Z", "share_note": "Use as is.", "wf_description": "After hours of debate on the state House floor, an oil tax credit bill is on its way to the Senate.", "organization": 2}, "model": "editorial.historicalwebfacet", "pk": 23}, {"fields": {"code": "", "excerpt": "U.S. Rep.

So the only land you have are the communities themselves. There are no other lands. There&rsquo;s no opportunity of any other type of resources development and you have to have resources development, in time you will need it. So if you don&rsquo;t want it, if Petersburg doesn&rsquo;t want it, that&rsquo;s your business. But I am still going to push for two million acres of land in Southeast Alaska for the people in Southeast Alaska for the improvement of each of their communities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Petersburg receives Payment in Lieu of Taxes, or PILT payments, because the borough cannot collect property tax on the federal land.</p>\r\n<p>Within the borough, 96 percent of the land is part of the national forest.</p>\r\n<p>The borough in the past has also received payments for schools and road work, under the Secure Rural Schools Act. That program, passed by Congress in 2000, increased and stabilized the forest receipt payments that had once depended on federal revenue from timber sales and other economic activity on national forests.</p>\r\n<p>It has meant hundreds of millions to rural communities near National Forests around the country. Both PILT payments and Secure Rural Schools need reauthorization by Congress to continue.</p>\r\n<p>Young said his bill wouldn&rsquo;t impact those payments.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to lose your PILT monies, you wont lose your Rural School monies if there&rsquo;s any monies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re gonna still maintain that. The whole thing was based on very frankly stumpage. We don&rsquo;t cut any more trees, so if they wanna save the trees then they oughta pay for it. And so I think your school funding, somewhat protected, maybe not increased but protected. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m predicting will happen. It&rsquo;s part of the program.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Both PILT and Secure Rural Schools payments are based on the amount of forest land in a borough. Audience members challenged Young on the point, questioning how Petersburg&rsquo;s federal payments could remain the same if there&rsquo;s less National Forest Land in Alaska.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t lose any money,&rdquo; Young said. &ldquo;If you lose any money, if you lose any money from that selection, I won&rsquo;t run again. OK? That&rsquo;s how confident I am you&rsquo;re not losing any money.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The topic of federal funding came up for other programs.</p>\r\n<p>Audience members thanked him for his past support of funding for Essential Air Service, the Alaska Sea Grant Program and public broadcasting.</p>\r\n<p>Those programs would be eliminated under a budget proposed by President Donald Trump.</p>\r\n<p>Young thinks Congress will approve a budget with those programs funded.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Now in the lower 48 it has been abused,&rdquo; Young said of the Essential Air Service which pays airlines to provide stops in Alaska communities. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s people put in airports, some of the members of Congress put airports in their hometowns when there&rsquo;s only another airport 20 miles away. But here we don&rsquo;t have that alternative. We&rsquo;re pretty sure the delegation is going to be able to protect the Essential Air Services for Alaska.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Alaska Airlines receives a $1.6 million payment to serve Petersburg each year.</p>\r\n<p>Young also was thanked for his lack of support for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which which withdrawn from the House when it lacked the votes.</p>\r\n<p>Young expected to have another bill on health insurance before the House by July.</p>\r\n<p>He also answered questions on climate change, enforcement of federal law on marijuana, cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and a repeal of prohibited hunting practices on federal wildlife refuges in Alaska.</p>\r\n<p>Young is visiting numerous communities around the state as well as attending a conference on the arctic in Seattle.</p>", "original_webfacet": true, "github_link": "", "pushed_to_wp": false, "history_date": "2017-04-23T09:45:51.340Z", "share_note": "Will be updated", "wf_description": "U.S. Rep.

Let&rsquo;s just say we can save 20 percent of that $5 billion. That&rsquo;s a billion dollars we&rsquo;re literally burning up every year.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In Alaska, though, Rose said state funding for biomass has dried up.</p>\r\n<p>Traditional banks don&rsquo;t like to invest in biomass, because they consider the technology too new, and therefore risky.</p>\r\n<p>Rose suggests that the state establish a &ldquo;Green Bank,&rdquo; an independent state agency, kind of like the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, that attracts private investors for biomass projects by providing some guarantees for the loans.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about not spending state money,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about leveraging state money and getting as much private money out of the markets as possible.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The model already exists, and Rose pointed to the Connecticut Green Bank as a success story.</p>\r\n<p>Canada already has taken a lead on encouraging biomass through policy. Several presenters from Canada talked about how that works for Alaska&rsquo;s closest neighbor.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Preto, a biomass researcher based out of British Columbia,&nbsp;said the Canadian federal government has specific policies in its proposed budget to support renewable and sustainable energy projects, including biomass, for the northern territories.</p>\r\n<p>The total for those projects is about $300 million Canadian.</p>\r\n<p>That huge swath of land is sparsely populated, even by Alaska standards, with small, isolated communities. And a large portion of the territories is treeless, too.</p>\r\n<p>So, like Alaska, there&rsquo;s no one solution that will fit all the needs. They have to get creative, Preto said, and policies have to be flexible. It&rsquo;s worth the investment, though, because of the potential long-term economic benefits.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you have wood resources, you have local employment, you have local development, but much more important than that is the capacity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In some communities, especially in northern Ontario, they are at the capacity (or) near the capacity of their diesel generators. When they reach 75 percent of capacity, they go into a load restriction status. Any local industry is told you have to cut back on your power consumption.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not an attractive situation for industries exploring new locations.</p>\r\n<p>Blair Hogan of the Teslin Tlingit Council in the Yukon also spoke. While they have hydro for their electric needs, they were on diesel for heat. He said their new biomass heat system uses chipped waste wood harvested locally.</p>\r\n<p>How did policy help them? Hogan said government grants were a major contributor. And with the new system, the community now has a source of local jobs and a way to reduce the area&rsquo;s wildfire risk.</p>\r\n<p>Ryan Hennessy, senior energy planner with the provincial government of Yukon,&nbsp;said the government has a &ldquo;basket of policies&rdquo; to increase the viability of biomass.</p>\r\n<p>One example is a policy to use biomass in public facilities and government buildings, which provides a large, steady customer for wood chips or pellets, thus supporting the industry.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What went along with the biomass energy strategy was public consultation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This proved very important to us. We heard a lot of things both for and against biomass. People were broadly in favor of biomass energy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>But, he said, people also had concerns about the potential for overharvesting, and environmental problems related to emissions.</p>\r\n<p>So, Hennessey said, they worked to calm concerns about timber supply and emissions &ndash; the newest technology provides a pretty clean burn &mdash; and they helped fund training within communities such as Teslin, teaching locals the various aspects of supplying and running a chip boiler.</p>\r\n<p>Washington and Oregon also have some established policies to encourage biomass.</p>\r\n<p>Dylan Kruse of Portland-based Sustainable Northwest said one of the challenges for biomass is, right now, it&rsquo;s more expensive than natural gas. But, he said, policies can narrow that price gap through tax credits, like those that drive solar and wind-energy projects.</p>\r\n<p>That would require people in the biomass industry to toot their own horns.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do it as well; we&rsquo;re not as proud of it. But we should be. It&rsquo;s renewable; it&rsquo;s base-load power, that&rsquo;s very valuable to utilities,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got diverse outputs and distribution, whether it&rsquo;s electricity or heat or even transportation fuels. We can save money and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and it has a lot of other great ancillary benefits, like supporting forest stewardship and controlled waste disposal.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>There are some federal programs in place that help, such as the U.S. Forest Service&rsquo;s wood energy grants.</p>\r\n<p>But, Kruse predicts there will be less help on the federal side in coming years, so the focus should be on increasing and improving policies within individual states.</p>\r\n<p>Kruse said the best way to encourage state policy is to talk with lawmakers and their staff, and to work with individual communities that are interested in biomass, so they, too, can lobby for state incentive policies.</p>", "original_webfacet": true, "github_link": "", "pushed_to_wp": false, "history_date": "2017-04-23T10:27:12.098Z", "share_note": "Use as needed", "wf_description": "Ketchikan hosted the annual Alaska Wood Energy Conference last week, where participants heard about how biomass works in different places, and how to make the technology more known, and eventually less expensive to install and operate.", "organization": 4}, "model": "editorial.historicalwebfacet", "pk": 32}, {"fields": {"code": "", "excerpt": "A seafood processing plant in Unalaska is on the hook for $3.2 million for breaking air pollution regulations.", "creation_date": "2017-04-23T10:29:02.918Z", "keywords": "[]", "owner": 11, "captions": "", "id": 18, "story": 16, "history_type": "+", "run_date": "2017-04-24T16:00:00Z", "title": "Air pollution violations will cost seafood processing plant $3.2 million", "discussion": 53, "editor": 10, "due_edit": "2017-04-24T15:30:00Z", "history_user": 11, "status": "In Progress", "wf_content": "<p>A seafood processing plant in Unalaska is on the hook for $3.2 million for breaking air pollution regulations.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement reached Thursday with the Environmental Protection Agency comes eight years after employees at Westward Seafoods turned off air pollution controls and falsified records to cover their tracks.</p>\r\n<p>Westward is required to install a new electronic monitoring system and $1 million will be spent on air pollution reduction.</p>", "original_webfacet": true, "github_link": "", "pushed_to_wp": false, "history_date": "2017-04-23T10:29:02.923Z", "share_note": "Will be updated", "wf_description": "A seafood processing plant in Unalaska is on the hook for $3.2 million for breaking air pollution regulations.", "organization": 4}, "model": "editorial.historicalwebfacet", "pk": 33}, {"fields": {"code": "", "excerpt": "A seafood processing plant in Unalaska is on the hook for $3.2 million for breaking air pollution regulations.", "creation_date": "2017-04-23T10:29:02.918Z", "keywords": "[]", "owner": 11, "captions": "", "id": 18, "story": 16, "history_type": "~", "run_date": "2017-04-24T16:00:00Z", "title": "Air pollution violations will cost seafood processing plant $3.2 million", "discussion": 53, "editor": 10, "due_edit": "2017-04-24T15:30:00Z", "history_user": 11, "status": "In Progress", "wf_content": "<p>A seafood processing plant in Unalaska is on the hook for $3.2 million for breaking air pollution regulations.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement reached Thursday with the Environmental Protection Agency comes eight years after employees at Westward Seafoods turned off air pollution controls and falsified records to cover their tracks.</p>\r\n<p>Westward is required to install a new electronic monitoring system and $1 million will be spent on air pollution reduction.</p>", "original_webfacet": true, "github_link": "", "pushed_to_wp": false, "history_date": "2017-04-23T10:29:44.135Z", "share_note": "Will be updated", "wf_description": "A seafood processing plant in Unalaska is on the hook for $3.2 million for breaking air pollution regulations.", "organization": 4}, "model": "editorial.historicalwebfacet", "pk": 34}, {"fields": {"code": "", "excerpt": "The foods we choose to put on our plates \u2014 or toss away \u2013 could have more of an ecological impact than many of us realize.", "creation_date": "2017-04-23T11:07:06.036Z", "keywords": "[\"Earth Day\", \" climate change\", \" diet\"]", "owner": 10, "captions": "", "id": 19, "story": 17, "history_type": "+", "run_date": "2017-04-24T19:00:00Z", "title": "Chew on this for Earth Day: How our diets impact the planet", "discussion": 55, "editor": 10, "due_edit": "2017-04-24T15:00:00Z", "history_user": 10, "status": "Ready", "wf_content": "<p>The foods we choose to put on our plates &mdash; or toss away &ndash; could have more of an ecological impact than many of us realize.</p>\r\n<p>On Earth Day, here are some ways to consider how our diet impacts the planet.</p>\r\n<p>Waste not, want not</p>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ve heard the numbers on food waste. More than 30 percent of available food is tossed each year in America. It&rsquo;s enough to fill Chicago&rsquo;s 1,450-foot-tall Willis Tower (formerly known as the Sears Tower) 44 times over.</p>\r\n<p>The U.S. has set an official goal to reduce food waste by 50 percent by the year 2030. Universities have begun to chip away at the food waste issue by promoting ugly fruit and vegetables and shifting away from pre-cooked, buffet style food, instead serving more cook-to-order options that can cut down on waste. Food service companies are working with farmers and chefs to get more blemished but edible produce into cafeterias across the country. Even religious groups are getting into the act, raising attention to the problem of food waste among the faithful and connecting with restaurants, retailers and food banks to help redirect food to hungry mouths that might otherwise end up in landfills.</p>\r\n<p>And there are a host of proposed solutions. Check out this report that highlights which solutions are likely to provide most bang for the buck. Among the most cost-effective strategies: educating consumers on food waste &ndash; including changes you can make in your own kitchen. (Here are some tips to get you started &ndash; like how to tell if eggs are still good past their expiration date.)</p>\r\n<p>Rethink your beef and lamb habit</p>\r\n<p>Everything we eat has an environmental footprint &ndash; it takes land, water and energy to grow crops and raise livestock. The folks at the World Resources Institute have calculated the greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing a gram of edible protein of various foods.</p>\r\n<p>Not surprisingly, they found that foods such as beans, fish, nuts and egg have the lowest impact. Poultry, pork, milk and cheese have medium-sized impacts. By far, the biggest impacts, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, were linked to beef, lamb and goat. (As we&rsquo;ve reported, that&rsquo;s partly because the need for pastureland drives deforestation in places like the Brazilian Amazon.)</p>\r\n<p>Why? According to WRI, beef uses 28 times more land per calorie consumed &mdash; and two to four times more freshwater &mdash; than the average of other livestock categories. What&rsquo;s more, cows are less efficient than other animals, like pigs and poultry, at converting feed into food.</p>\r\n<p>Still, telling people to go cold turkey with their red meat isn&rsquo;t likely to inspire real change. But this message might resonate: Even if you don&rsquo;t give up on red meat consumption entirely, just cutting back can significantly impact your diet&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</p>\r\n<p>And these days, there are lots of vegan substitutes &ndash; like plant burgers that sizzle, smell and even bleed like the real thing &mdash; that can deliver the meaty taste you crave as you try to scale back.</p>\r\n<p>Keep an eye out for more &lsquo;plant-based&rsquo; dishes on restaurant menus</p>\r\n<p>As interest in plant-centric diets booms, new food businesses have taken root &ndash; from the veggie-centric fast-casual chains Beefsteak (from celebrity chef Jose Andres) and Chloe (an all-vegan restaurant) to the vegan meal-kit company Purple Carrot.</p>\r\n<p>Now, a new initiative from the World Resources Institute called the Better Buying Lab is bringing together big companies (including Panera Bread, Sodexo, Google, Unilever and Hilton) to develop and test strategies to nudge consumers towards choosing more sustainable foods. One initiative is to get more plant-based dishes onto menus.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you look at menus across the U.S., there tends to be [the same] 25 dishes that are on the majority of menus,&rdquo; says Daniel Vennard, director of the Better Buying Lab at WRI. Think burgers, chicken dishes, etc. &ldquo;Not many [plant-based] dishes have scaled to become national favorites,&rdquo; Vennard says.</p>\r\n<p>His group is working to change that. It&rsquo;s teaming up with chefs from its member companies to create new recipes likely to have broad appeal. Promising ideas include the concept of &ldquo;superfood salads&rdquo; &mdash; containing combinations of nuts, seeds, greens, veggies and avocado.</p>\r\n<p>He points to ideas already out there as well, such as burgers that blend meat and mushrooms. As we reported several years ago, some taste-testing has found that diners warmed up to the idea of blended burgers, and in fact many tasters preferred them to all-beef patties. And an ongoing competition from the James Beard Foundation has encouraged chefs around the country to give blended burgers a try on their menus. (Not everyone is a fan, though.)</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re trying to do is shift consumers towards eating more sustainable food, but we&rsquo;re not advocating for a no-meat diet,&rdquo; explains Vennard. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re saying, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s moderate.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>", "original_webfacet": true, "github_link": "", "pushed_to_wp": false, "history_date": "2017-04-23T11:07:06.045Z", "share_note": "Use as is.", "wf_description": "Science story on climate change and human diets", "organization": 3}, "model": "editorial.historicalwebfacet", "pk": 35}, {"fields": {"code": "", "excerpt": "The foods we choose to put on our plates \u2014 or toss away \u2013 could have more of an ecological impact than many of us realize.", "creation_date": "2017-04-23T11:07:06.036Z", "keywords": "[\"Earth Day\", \" climate change\", \" diet\"]", "owner": 10, "captions": "", "id": 19, "story": 17, "history_type": "~", "run_date": "2017-04-24T19:00:00Z", "title": "Chew on this for Earth Day: How our diets impact the planet", "discussion": 55, "editor": 10, "due_edit": "2017-04-24T15:00:00Z", "history_user": 10, "status": "Ready", "wf_content": "<p>The foods we choose to put on our plates &mdash; or toss away &ndash; could have more of an ecological impact than many of us realize.</p>\r\n<p>On Earth Day, here are some ways to consider how our diet impacts the planet.</p>\r\n<p>Waste not, want not</p>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ve heard the numbers on food waste.

Universities have begun to chip away at the food waste issue by promoting ugly fruit and vegetables and shifting away from pre-cooked, buffet style food, instead serving more cook-to-order options that can cut down on waste. Food service companies are working with farmers and chefs to get more blemished but edible produce into cafeterias across the country. Even religious groups are getting into the act, raising attention to the problem of food waste among the faithful and connecting with restaurants, retailers and food banks to help redirect food to hungry mouths that might otherwise end up in landfills.</p>\r\n<p>And there are a host of proposed solutions. Check out this report that highlights which solutions are likely to provide most bang for the buck. Among the most cost-effective strategies: educating consumers on food waste &ndash; including changes you can make in your own kitchen. (Here are some tips to get you started &ndash; like how to tell if eggs are still good past their expiration date.)</p>\r\n<p>Rethink your beef and lamb habit</p>\r\n<p>Everything we eat has an environmental footprint &ndash; it takes land, water and energy to grow crops and raise livestock. The folks at the World Resources Institute have calculated the greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing a gram of edible protein of various foods.</p>\r\n<p>Not surprisingly, they found that foods such as beans, fish, nuts and egg have the lowest impact. Poultry, pork, milk and cheese have medium-sized impacts. By far, the biggest impacts, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, were linked to beef, lamb and goat. (As we&rsquo;ve reported, that&rsquo;s partly because the need for pastureland drives deforestation in places like the Brazilian Amazon.)</p>\r\n<p>Why? According to WRI, beef uses 28 times more land per calorie consumed &mdash; and two to four times more freshwater &mdash; than the average of other livestock categories. What&rsquo;s more, cows are less efficient than other animals, like pigs and poultry, at converting feed into food.</p>\r\n<p>Still, telling people to go cold turkey with their red meat isn&rsquo;t likely to inspire real change. But this message might resonate: Even if you don&rsquo;t give up on red meat consumption entirely, just cutting back can significantly impact your diet&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</p>\r\n<p>And these days, there are lots of vegan substitutes &ndash; like plant burgers that sizzle, smell and even bleed like the real thing &mdash; that can deliver the meaty taste you crave as you try to scale back.</p>\r\n<p>Keep an eye out for more &lsquo;plant-based&rsquo; dishes on restaurant menus</p>\r\n<p>As interest in plant-centric diets booms, new food businesses have taken root &ndash; from the veggie-centric fast-casual chains Beefsteak (from celebrity chef Jose Andres) and Chloe (an all-vegan restaurant) to the vegan meal-kit company Purple Carrot.</p>\r\n<p>Now, a new initiative from the World Resources Institute called the Better Buying Lab is bringing together big companies (including Panera Bread, Sodexo, Google, Unilever and Hilton) to develop and test strategies to nudge consumers towards choosing more sustainable foods. One initiative is to get more plant-based dishes onto menus.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you look at menus across the U.S., there tends to be [the same] 25 dishes that are on the majority of menus,&rdquo; says Daniel Vennard, director of the Better Buying Lab at WRI. Think burgers, chicken dishes, etc. &ldquo;Not many [plant-based] dishes have scaled to become national favorites,&rdquo; Vennard says.</p>\r\n<p>His group is working to change that. It&rsquo;s teaming up with chefs from its member companies to create new recipes likely to have broad appeal. Promising ideas include the concept of &ldquo;superfood salads&rdquo; &mdash; containing combinations of nuts, seeds, greens, veggies and avocado.</p>\r\n<p>He points to ideas already out there as well, such as burgers that blend meat and mushrooms. As we reported several years ago, some taste-testing has found that diners warmed up to the idea of blended burgers, and in fact many tasters preferred them to all-beef patties. And an ongoing competition from the James Beard Foundation has encouraged chefs around the country to give blended burgers a try on their menus. (Not everyone is a fan, though.)</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re trying to do is shift consumers towards eating more sustainable food, but we&rsquo;re not advocating for a no-meat diet,&rdquo; explains Vennard. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re saying, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s moderate.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>", "original_webfacet": true, "github_link": "", "pushed_to_wp": false, "history_date": "2017-04-23T11:08:34.987Z", "share_note": "Use as is.", "wf_description": "Science story on climate change and human diets", "organization": 3}, "model": "editorial.historicalwebfacet", "pk": 36}, {"fields": {"code": "", "excerpt": "Scientists are pointing to climate change as the reason a river that used to feed into the Yukon has nearly disappeared.", "creation_date": "2017-04-23T11:12:21.800Z", "keywords": "[\"Nature Geoscience\", \" Kaskawulsh Glacier\", \" Canada\", \" University of Washington\", \" climate change\"]", "owner": 10, "captions": "", "id": 20, "story": 18, "history_type": "+", "run_date": "2017-04-26T13:00:00Z", "title": "In a rare case of river piracy, climate change is the culprit", "discussion": 57, "editor": 10, "due_edit": "2017-04-25T17:00:00Z", "history_user": 10, "status": "Ready", "wf_content": "<p>Scientists are pointing to climate change as the reason a river that used to feed into the Yukon has nearly disappeared.</p>\r\n<p>A report published in Nature Geoscience on Monday says it&rsquo;s the first documented case of river piracy in modern times &mdash; linked to the planet heating up.

But the oil and gas company and its allies are still struggling to contain another issue: environmental groups, which argue that Hilcorp&rsquo;s problems in Cook Inlet disqualify the company from drilling for oil in the Arctic Ocean.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier this month, Lois Epstein of the Wilderness Society in Anchorage wrote an op-ed in the Alaska Dispatch News. Epstein&rsquo;s headline read: &ldquo;Hilcorp&rsquo;s Cook Inlet leaks underscore Arctic risks.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I certainly have, and I know others have, enormous concerns about Hilcorp being the operator of this new operation in the Arctic,&rdquo; Epstein said in an interview. &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s a company that doesn&rsquo;t appear to have a strong handle on its operations.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Epstein noted that Hilcorp&rsquo;s gas leak in Cook Inlet took months to fix, as dangerous ice conditions prevented divers from getting to the pipeline. The company also had to shut down two other pipelines in the Inlet this spring due to suspected leaks. Epstein said the incidents raise questions about a project the company is pursuing hundreds of miles to the north.</p>\r\n<p>Hilcorp is moving ahead with the only offshore drilling project currently planned in federal Arctic waters. It&rsquo;s called Liberty. Hilcorp wants to build a gravel island in shallow waters about six miles from the Beaufort Sea coast. According to plans submitted to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the oil would flow to shore via a buried subsea pipeline.</p>\r\n<p>Epstein said&nbsp;that Hilcorp&rsquo;s gas leak in Cook Inlet was hard to fix &mdash; and repairing a pipe or cleaning up an oil spill in Arctic waters would be a lot harder.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You do have lots of other challenges in the Arctic,&rdquo; said Epstein. &ldquo;You have storms, you have certainly cold, you have remoteness, you have the inability to respond very quickly because you don&rsquo;t have the people power and the infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>A growing number of national environmental groups agree with Epstein &mdash; including the Center for Biological Diversity and Greenpeace. They&rsquo;re calling for the federal government to scrutinize Hilcorp&rsquo;s safety record before approving the Liberty Project. And as President Donald Trump weighs an executive order to step back the Obama administration&rsquo;s five-year moratorium on Arctic drilling, some groups argue the gas leak shows oil development in the Arctic shouldn&rsquo;t happen at all.</p>\r\n<p>But the pushback from the oil industry has come hard and fast.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nonsensical; it makes no sense to say, &lsquo;because we had a leak over here means they will never be able to respond to a leak in the Arctic.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s just a fabrication,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Kara Moriarty, who leads the Alaska Oil and Gas Association.</p>\r\n<p>Moriarty wrote her own op-ed in the Alaska Dispatch News. It was just one of a wave of opinion pieces condemning environmental groups&rsquo; arguments, which appeared in both local and national media.</p>\r\n<p>Moriarty argued recent incidents involving Hilcorp don&rsquo;t mean the company can&rsquo;t operate safely in the Arctic.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When something happens, the company responds, they change their behavior, they pay their fine, and they change their process &mdash; that&rsquo;s why you have regulatory oversight,&rdquo; said Moriarty. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not to say, &lsquo;oh, a company did something and we fined them, and and now they shouldn&rsquo;t do anything else in Alaska again.'&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Hilcorp didn&rsquo;t agree to an interview for this story, but in an emailed statement, Hilcorp&rsquo;s Alaska Senior Vice President David Wilkins said the Liberty project is &ldquo;vastly different&rdquo; from its operations in Cook Inlet.

Proponents said that it will stabilize the state&rsquo;s tax regime and get Alaska a larger share of the profits from its oil.</p>\r\n<p>Opponents said they were rushed in reviewing the latest version of the bill. &nbsp;And, they say that increasing taxes on oil industry when prices are down will drive away the industry Alaska relies on for most of its money.</p>\r\n<p>volume.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Alaska is one step closer to getting another oil tax credit overhaul. Representatives in the State House voted to send a contentious bill over to the Senate.</p>\r\n<p>Facing stiff opposition to a tax hike from Senate Republicans, the House Finance committee that put out the latest version of the bill tied it to a Senate-approved permanent fund bill. They added language that said the permanent fund bill will only pass in the House if the House&rsquo;s version of the oil tax credit bill passes in the Senate.</p>\r\n<p>The latest oil tax credit overhaul drew a lot of criticism from opponents in the House who said that it goes beyond fixing a cash-for-credit system that many said the state cannot afford.</p>\r\n<p>Wasilla Republican Delena Johnson and many of her colleagues in the House minority said they did not have enough time to look over the newest version of the bill. It was put out on Friday.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;To take on this bill without understanding the consequence. Having it sneaked in at the last minute, having less than 12 hours to put in amendments, it just doesn&rsquo;t make good sense,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n<p>In its current form, the bill drops a program that offered&nbsp;tax credits that can be transferred to other companies or exchanged for cash for work done on the North Slope. The state&rsquo;s delayed payments on those tax credits has resulted in a tab that will reach about $900 million this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a provision that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree with. Especially since there have been large discoveries on the North Slope that could leave the state on the hook for billions in credit liabilities before it makes any taxes or royalties from those developments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Proponents of the bill said that it&rsquo;s a better idea to reform the tax credit system to into something the state can actually afford, rather than continue along with credits that the state has to delay paying.</p>\r\n<p>In the new bill, companies would be expected to carry their losses until they are producing oil and owe a tax liability to the state &mdash; then they could use those losses to offset those taxes.</p>\r\n<p>A new addition to the bill cuts off a per-barrel credit given for oil production. But, it also drops the base tax rate for the North Slope by 10 percent.</p>\r\n<p>If the oil industry investment in the state stays the same, and oil prices don&rsquo;t change dramatically, the Department of Revenue forecasts that the new oil tax credit system would raise oil income to the state for at least the next decade. &nbsp;According to its projections, the state could bring in $130 million more in revenue by 2019 all the way up to $475 million more by 2027.</p>\r\n<p>But there are a lot of caveats to that projection, and the bill isn&rsquo;t assured to pass in its current form.</p>\r\n<p>Opponents and industry representatives have repeatedly argued that the state changes its oil tax credit regime too often.</p>\r\n<p>Alaska&rsquo;s Revenue commissioner Randall Hoffbeck said the political infighting and instability in the state&rsquo;s oil tax credit system go hand-in-hand.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;ve got a state that&rsquo;s 50/50 split and a legislature that&rsquo;s 50/50 split on whether the current tax structure is an appropriate tax structure, there will always be a large amount of uncertainty in the underlying tax structure,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What we need to do is get to a tax structure that enough people say &lsquo;That is good enough. We&rsquo;re going to leave it alone and we&rsquo;re going to leave it alone for a long time.'&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Hoffbeck said having a predictable tax system is more important than the actual amount of tax revenue the state brings in.</p>\r\n<p>Opponents also question the idea of raising taxes on the industry at a time when oil prices are low. The oil and gas industry has shed thousands of jobs since record high employment in 2015. And it&rsquo;s projected to lose another 1,500 this year.</p>\r\n<p>Fairbanks Republican Steve Thompson said a tax hike will cause more people to lose their jobs.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The oil companies have said they&rsquo;re going to be laying down drill rigs if this is what we&rsquo;re going to end up doing because we will not be profitable,&rdquo; Thompson said.</p>\r\n<p>But many in the Democrat-led majority caucus said that industry will not walk away from Alaska citing other states and countries with higher tax rates and the state&rsquo;s high-quality oil.</p>\r\n<p>Fairbanks Democrat David Guttenberg said Alaskans should look at what the multinational oil companies say about Alaska in their shareholder meetings. He says Prudhoe Bay will remain an attractive place to invest.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Part of what they have successfully conveyed to this legislature, which has always bothered me, is that their shareholders are more important than our people,&rdquo; Guttenberg said.</p>\r\n<p>Guttenberg and 20 other legislators in the House are betting that the industry can handle the pressure. But, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of time left in the regular session for the Senate to decide what it&rsquo;s going to do. Next Sunday is the 90-day session deadline, but without a fiscal plan for the state or resolution on oil tax credits, lawmakers will likely continue to meet.</p>", "original_webfacet": true, "github_link": "", "pushed_to_wp": false, "history_date": "2017-05-08T16:13:51.557Z", "share_note": "Use as is.", "wf_description": "After hours of debate on the state House floor, an oil tax credit bill is on its way to the Senate.", "organization": 2}, "model": "editorial.historicalwebfacet", "pk": 64}, {"fields": {"code": "", "excerpt": "Critics of the new Inupiat Eskimo name of the nation\u2019s northernmost town are taking their opposition to trial, despite losing a key legal fight last month.", "creation_date": "2017-04-23T09:27:08.736Z", "keywords": "[\"Barrow\", \" Utqiagvik\"]", "owner": 2, "captions": "", "id": 11, "story": 9, "history_type": "~", "run_date": "2017-05-09T13:30:00Z", "title": "Trial date set in lawsuit challenging Alaska town\u2019s new name", "discussion": 39, "editor": 2, "due_edit": "2017-05-08T21:00:00Z", "history_user": 2, "status": "In Progress", "wf_content": "<p>Critics of the new Inupiat Eskimo name of the nation&rsquo;s northernmost town are taking their opposition to trial, despite losing a key legal fight last month.</p>\r\n<p>Alaska Superior Court Judge Paul Roetman on Wednesday set a Jan. 22 trial date in Utqiagvik, the city formerly known as Barrow.</p>\r\n<p>The new name is being challenged by a local Alaska Native corporation that argues the city broke its own laws by failing to publish a public notice before the renaming question was put before local voters last October.</p>\r\n<p>In March, Roetman denied the plaintiff&rsquo;s request to halt implementation of the new name until the lawsuit is resolved.</p>\r\n<p>Roetman said opponents failed to show that continuing the transition process would harm them or that they would probably succeed in making their case.</p>", "original_webfacet": true, "github_link": "", "pushed_to_wp": false, "history_date": "2017-05-08T16:14:10.050Z", "share_note": "Will be updated", "wf_description": "Critics of the new Inupiat Eskimo name of the nation\u2019s northernmost town are taking their opposition to trial, despite losing a key legal fight last month.", "organization": 2}, "model": "editorial.historicalwebfacet", "pk": 65}, {"fields": {"code": "", "excerpt": "\"#722LIFE.

Seals, for example, have to travel further to find food, dive deeper and for a longer period of time, and are resting less.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;All of which means, of course, it costs much more to get the food that you require,&rdquo; Kovacs said. &ldquo;That will eventually have reproductive consequences and growth consequences for these animals. You see that kind of phenomenon in many different species right now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Polar bears usually hunt seals on the sea ice.</p>\r\n<p>But Kathy Kuletz of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said polar bears have been observed foraging for food by going after ground-nesting common eiders or cliff-nesting murres.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When the bears show up, they disturb the birds, the birds fly off,&rdquo; Kuletz said. &ldquo;That not only means that the bears are going after the chicks and eggs that they can get on the cliffs, but when the adult birds leave, because they&rsquo;ve been startled by the bear, the other predators like gulls will come in and attack the eggs and chicks. It&rsquo;s not just what the bears eat, but the disruption in the colony, as well.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Connie Lovejoy of Quebec&rsquo;s Universit&eacute; Laval said they can no longer take data from a particular event and extrapolate to the entire Arctic. For example, higher ocean temperatures may prompt an increase in small, warm water plankton called copepods in one region of the Arctic and an increase of fattier, cold water copepods on the opposite side of the Arctic.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;My big worry is really that by simplifying the system and not having enough data, those nuances, those small differences regionally, they&rsquo;re lost,&rdquo; Lovejoy said. &ldquo;If you want to have local communities able to exploit their resources in the Arctic, they actually need to have a more accurate picture of what the future of their region is going to look like because there is no one Arctic.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>While some countries continuously monitor certain species, other countries may only do research that coincides with specific, short-term projects.</p>\r\n<p>The 200-page report on Arctic marine biodiversity was produced by the Arctic Council&rsquo;s Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna working group.

MORGENTHUGS.</p>\r\n<p>That statement has been splashed across the side of a World War II bunker in Unalaska, leaving some residents outraged on social media.</p>\r\n<p>On a rare sunny day in March, Dmitri Dane hiked up the back side of Mount Ballyhoo, where military structures from World War II still look out over the Bering Sea.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing,&rdquo; said Dane. &ldquo;You can see the mountain range, you can see Hog Island, and the bunkers are on the very edge of the cliff.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As a landscape photographer, Dane said it&rsquo;s one of the best views in Unalaska.

But these big black letters were spray-painted on the outside of the bunker &mdash; not hidden inside like most graffiti.</p>\r\n<p>Dane snapped a photo of the tag, posted it on Facebook, and watched as the comments poured in.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I got a lot of angry people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not at me, but a lot of them were angry toward the supposed people who wrote it on there.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>No one&rsquo;s really sure who tagged the bunker, but the graffiti provides some clues.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It felt like a punch in the gut when you see it has a U.S. Coast Guard tag on it,&rdquo; said Carlin Enlow, director of the Unalaska Convention and Visitors Bureau.</p>\r\n<p>She saw the photo online and drew the same conclusion as a lot of commenters &mdash; that the bunker was defaced by crew members of the Coast Guard Cutter Morgenthau, designated number 722.</p>\r\n<p>For years, the cutter has stopped in Unalaska on patrol in the Bering Sea, protecting marine resources and helping with search and rescue.</p>\r\n<p>For Enlow, that mission makes the tag even harder to stomach.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a group of people who are supposed to serve and protect us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All these questions come to mind. Obviously, why? Why would you do that?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Morgenthau&rsquo;s commanding officer looked into the matter after KUCB requested comment.</p>\r\n<p>The extent of the Coast Guard&rsquo;s investigation is unclear, but officials say there&rsquo;s &ldquo;no information available&rdquo; to confirm if crew members are responsible.</p>\r\n<p>In the past, the landowning company has given Coast Guard crews permission to paint the names and numbers of their vessels on blast shields decorating the side of Mount Ballyhoo, where the military stashed munitions during the war.</p>\r\n<p>Ounalashka Corporation CEO Chris Salts said the native corporation has always had a good relationship with the Coast Guard, and he&rsquo;s not up in arms over this new piece of graffiti.

He said&nbsp;the offer was declined to keep those costs from showing up in ratepayers&rsquo; monthly bills.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We told them that because of the significant cost of backing up their wind, that the financial harm to our members would be too great,&rdquo; Borgeson said, &ldquo;And (that) we&rsquo;d be unable to purchase any of their power.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the basis of a tariff GVEA filed March 15 with the Regulatory Commission of Alaska, or RCA, that explains why Golden Valley should be exempted from state and federal regulations and policies requiring utilities to buy renewable power, whenever possible.</p>\r\n<p>Craft and his attorney, Teresa Clemmer, say GVEA has failed to make that case.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We think the assumptions that they use to kind of shoehorn that conclusion are totally without merit,&rdquo; Clemmer said.</p>\r\n<p>Clemmer&nbsp;and Craft say Golden Valley&rsquo;s tariff is unlawful and &ldquo;riddled with outlandish assumptions and false statements.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Clemmer argued in a 527-page response she filed with the RCA last week that the utility&rsquo;s leadership misinterprets and disregards state regulations that were established to help promote renewable-energy sources such as wind.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was really just a complete rejection of everything the regulations required,&rdquo; Clemmer said.</p>\r\n<p>Clemmer zeroed in on Golden Valley&rsquo;s claim that it can only use the older diesel-burning generators to back-up the wind power that&rsquo;s produced by the two-megawatt facility Craft presently operates in Delta, along with GVEA&rsquo;s own 25-megawatt Eva Creek Wind farm, near Healy.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We just think they are misleading the public by trying to say that it&rsquo;s only the diesel-fired power that&rsquo;s going to be backing up the wind,&rdquo; Clemmer said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Clemmer and Craft argue that GVEA can back-up intermittent wind power with facilities that burn, quote, &ldquo;reasonably priced power,&rdquo;

Representatives in the State House voted to send a contentious bill over to the Senate.</p>\r\n<p>Facing stiff opposition to a tax hike from Senate Republicans, the House Finance committee that put out the latest version of the bill tied it to a Senate-approved permanent fund bill. They added language that said the permanent fund bill will only pass in the House if the House&rsquo;s version of the oil tax credit bill passes in the Senate.</p>\r\n<p>The latest oil tax credit overhaul drew a lot of criticism from opponents in the House who said that it goes beyond fixing a cash-for-credit system that many said the state cannot afford.</p>\r\n<p>Wasilla Republican Delena Johnson and many of her colleagues in the House minority said they did not have enough time to look over the newest version of the bill. It was put out on Friday.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;To take on this bill without understanding the consequence. Having it sneaked in at the last minute, having less than 12 hours to put in amendments, it just doesn&rsquo;t make good sense,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n<p>In its current form, the bill drops a program that offered&nbsp;tax credits that can be transferred to other companies or exchanged for cash for work done on the North Slope. The state&rsquo;s delayed payments on those tax credits has resulted in a tab that will reach about $900 million this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a provision that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree with. Especially since there have been large discoveries on the North Slope that could leave the state on the hook for billions in credit liabilities before it makes any taxes or royalties from those developments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Proponents of the bill said that it&rsquo;s a better idea to reform the tax credit system to into something the state can actually afford, rather than continue along with credits that the state has to delay paying.</p>\r\n<p>In the new bill, companies would be expected to carry their losses until they are producing oil and owe a tax liability to the state &mdash; then they could use those losses to offset those taxes.</p>\r\n<p>A new addition to the bill cuts off a per-barrel credit given for oil production. But, it also drops the base tax rate for the North Slope by 10 percent.</p>\r\n<p>If the oil industry investment in the state stays the same, and oil prices don&rsquo;t change dramatically, the Department of Revenue forecasts that the new oil tax credit system would raise oil income to the state for at least the next decade. &nbsp;According to its projections, the state could bring in $130 million more in revenue by 2019 all the way up to $475 million more by 2027.</p>\r\n<p>But there are a lot of caveats to that projection, and the bill isn&rsquo;t assured to pass in its current form.</p>\r\n<p>Opponents and industry representatives have repeatedly argued that the state changes its oil tax credit regime too often.</p>\r\n<p>Alaska&rsquo;s Revenue commissioner Randall Hoffbeck said the political infighting and instability in the state&rsquo;s oil tax credit system go hand-in-hand.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;ve got a state that&rsquo;s 50/50 split and a legislature that&rsquo;s 50/50 split on whether the current tax structure is an appropriate tax structure, there will always be a large amount of uncertainty in the underlying tax structure,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What we need to do is get to a tax structure that enough people say &lsquo;That is good enough. We&rsquo;re going to leave it alone and we&rsquo;re going to leave it alone for a long time.'&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Hoffbeck said having a predictable tax system is more important than the actual amount of tax revenue the state brings in.</p>\r\n<p>Opponents also question the idea of raising taxes on the industry at a time when oil prices are low. The oil and gas industry has shed thousands of jobs since record high employment in 2015. And it&rsquo;s projected to lose another 1,500 this year.</p>\r\n<p>Fairbanks Republican Steve Thompson said a tax hike will cause more people to lose their jobs.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The oil companies have said they&rsquo;re going to be laying down drill rigs if this is what we&rsquo;re going to end up doing because we will not be profitable,&rdquo; Thompson said.</p>\r\n<p>But many in the Democrat-led majority caucus said that industry will not walk away from Alaska citing other states and countries with higher tax rates and the state&rsquo;s high-quality oil.</p>\r\n<p>Fairbanks Democrat David Guttenberg said Alaskans should look at what the multinational oil companies say about Alaska in their shareholder meetings. He says Prudhoe Bay will remain an attractive place to invest.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Part of what they have successfully conveyed to this legislature, which has always bothered me, is that their shareholders are more important than our people,&rdquo; Guttenberg said.</p>\r\n<p>Guttenberg and 20 other legislators in the House are betting that the industry can handle the pressure. But, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of time left in the regular session for the Senate to decide what it&rsquo;s going to do. Next Sunday is the 90-day session deadline, but without a fiscal plan for the state or resolution on oil tax credits, lawmakers will likely continue to meet.</p>", "original_webfacet": true, "github_link": "", "pushed_to_wp": false, "share_note": "Use as is.", "document_assets": [], "credit": [4], "wf_description": "After hours of debate on the state House floor, an oil tax credit bill is on its way to the Senate.", "video_assets": [], "organization": 2}, "model": "editorial.webfacet", "pk": 12}, {"fields": {"code": "", "audio_assets": [], "excerpt": "U.S. Rep.

So the only land you have are the communities themselves. There are no other lands. There&rsquo;s no opportunity of any other type of resources development and you have to have resources development, in time you will need it.

That program, passed by Congress in 2000, increased and stabilized the forest receipt payments that had once depended on federal revenue from timber sales and other economic activity on national forests.</p>\r\n<p>It has meant hundreds of millions to rural communities near National Forests around the country. Both PILT payments and Secure Rural Schools need reauthorization by Congress to continue.</p>\r\n<p>Young said his bill wouldn&rsquo;t impact those payments.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to lose your PILT monies, you wont lose your Rural School monies if there&rsquo;s any monies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re gonna still maintain that. The whole thing was based on very frankly stumpage. We don&rsquo;t cut any more trees, so if they wanna save the trees then they oughta pay for it. And so I think your school funding, somewhat protected, maybe not increased but protected. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m predicting will happen. It&rsquo;s part of the program.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Both PILT and Secure Rural Schools payments are based on the amount of forest land in a borough. Audience members challenged Young on the point, questioning how Petersburg&rsquo;s federal payments could remain the same if there&rsquo;s less National Forest Land in Alaska.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t lose any money,&rdquo; Young said. &ldquo;If you lose any money, if you lose any money from that selection, I won&rsquo;t run again. OK? That&rsquo;s how confident I am you&rsquo;re not losing any money.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The topic of federal funding came up for other programs.</p>\r\n<p>Audience members thanked him for his past support of funding for Essential Air Service, the Alaska Sea Grant Program and public broadcasting.</p>\r\n<p>Those programs would be eliminated under a budget proposed by President Donald Trump.</p>\r\n<p>Young thinks Congress will approve a budget with those programs funded.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Now in the lower 48 it has been abused,&rdquo; Young said of the Essential Air Service which pays airlines to provide stops in Alaska communities. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s people put in airports, some of the members of Congress put airports in their hometowns when there&rsquo;s only another airport 20 miles away. But here we don&rsquo;t have that alternative.

This, combined with aerial surveys, will help the researchers build a map that shows goats&rsquo; summer and winter habitat in the Northern Lynn Canal.</p>\r\n<p>One of White and his colleagues&rsquo; discoveries has to do with where area mountain goats spend winters. Goats in coastal climates tend to winter at lower elevations. Their counterparts in interior climates winter at higher elevations. Haines has a transitional clime, so the goats are more unpredictable.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have a couple places like Takhin Ridge and the Kicking Horse that are complicated,&rdquo; White said. &ldquo;Where on average most of the animals are wintering below tree line, but then we have some animals that are wintering above. So we actually even see mixed wintering strategies within a given geography.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>This variety of wintering patterns will be taken into account in the habitat map that comes out of the study.</p>\r\n<p>White gave examples of how the habitat map could be used with heliski maps. He said in some cases, there might be no overlap, or the heliski boundaries could be shifted slightly.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But then it&rsquo;s not necessarily always that simple,&rsquo; White said.</p>\r\n<p>He showed an example of winter goat habitat at high elevations in the Four Winds Mountain.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In this case what might need to occur, if mountain goat conservation is the goal, would be to contract the area where helicopter skiing is allowed,&rdquo; White said. &ldquo;This would be a harder decision to make because it would be taking area off the map from helicopter skiing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The chair of the most recent Haines heliski map committee, Ron Jackson, asked White whether&nbsp;he thinks the borough heliski map will have much overlap with goat habitat.</p>\r\n<p>Without question, there are conflicts, White said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s going to be the hard challenge for the managers, is to decide how do you deal with that situation?&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>Haines is still deciding what process to follow with its next attempt to review heliski map boundaries. That&rsquo;s set to happen after Fish and Game finishes this study, which White said should be in a couple months.</p>\r\n<p>White also gave a big picture reason why people may want to make mountain goat conservation a priority: climate change.</p>\r\n<p>He put together research that shows climate change will have a negative impact on goats because warm temperatures hurt their chances of survival.</p>\r\n<p>White said, best case scenario, Alaska goat populations decline.

There are federal laws that don&rsquo;t allow covenants to be placed on federal land.</p>\r\n<p>Micciche says he was expecting to hear from the federal government.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We feel they should be held at the same standard,&rdquo; Micciche said. &ldquo;And we think it&rsquo;s important and as you can imagine in this building a note from the feds in opposition to a bill is not always a bad thing. And I don&rsquo;t say that lightly, it just happens to be the case.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Other states that have enacted similar bills have found a way around the federal laws.

Let&rsquo;s just say we can save 20 percent of that $5 billion. That&rsquo;s a billion dollars we&rsquo;re literally burning up every year.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In Alaska, though, Rose said state funding for biomass has dried up.</p>\r\n<p>Traditional banks don&rsquo;t like to invest in biomass, because they consider the technology too new, and therefore risky.</p>\r\n<p>Rose suggests that the state establish a &ldquo;Green Bank,&rdquo; an independent state agency, kind of like the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, that attracts private investors for biomass projects by providing some guarantees for the loans.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about not spending state money,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about leveraging state money and getting as much private money out of the markets as possible.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The model already exists, and Rose pointed to the Connecticut Green Bank as a success story.</p>\r\n<p>Canada already has taken a lead on encouraging biomass through policy. Several presenters from Canada talked about how that works for Alaska&rsquo;s closest neighbor.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Preto, a biomass researcher based out of British Columbia,&nbsp;said the Canadian federal government has specific policies in its proposed budget to support renewable and sustainable energy projects, including biomass, for the northern territories.</p>\r\n<p>The total for those projects is about $300 million Canadian.</p>\r\n<p>That huge swath of land is sparsely populated, even by Alaska standards, with small, isolated communities. And a large portion of the territories is treeless, too.</p>\r\n<p>So, like Alaska, there&rsquo;s no one solution that will fit all the needs. They have to get creative, Preto said, and policies have to be flexible. It&rsquo;s worth the investment, though, because of the potential long-term economic benefits.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you have wood resources, you have local employment, you have local development, but much more important than that is the capacity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In some communities, especially in northern Ontario, they are at the capacity (or) near the capacity of their diesel generators. When they reach 75 percent of capacity, they go into a load restriction status. Any local industry is told you have to cut back on your power consumption.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not an attractive situation for industries exploring new locations.</p>\r\n<p>Blair Hogan of the Teslin Tlingit Council in the Yukon also spoke. While they have hydro for their electric needs, they were on diesel for heat. He said their new biomass heat system uses chipped waste wood harvested locally.</p>\r\n<p>How did policy help them? Hogan said government grants were a major contributor. And with the new system, the community now has a source of local jobs and a way to reduce the area&rsquo;s wildfire risk.</p>\r\n<p>Ryan Hennessy, senior energy planner with the provincial government of Yukon,&nbsp;said the government has a &ldquo;basket of policies&rdquo; to increase the viability of biomass.</p>\r\n<p>One example is a policy to use biomass in public facilities and government buildings, which provides a large, steady customer for wood chips or pellets, thus supporting the industry.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What went along with the biomass energy strategy was public consultation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This proved very important to us. We heard a lot of things both for and against biomass. People were broadly in favor of biomass energy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>But, he said, people also had concerns about the potential for overharvesting, and environmental problems related to emissions.</p>\r\n<p>So, Hennessey said, they worked to calm concerns about timber supply and emissions &ndash; the newest technology provides a pretty clean burn &mdash; and they helped fund training within communities such as Teslin, teaching locals the various aspects of supplying and running a chip boiler.</p>\r\n<p>Washington and Oregon also have some established policies to encourage biomass.</p>\r\n<p>Dylan Kruse of Portland-based Sustainable Northwest said one of the challenges for biomass is, right now, it&rsquo;s more expensive than natural gas. But, he said, policies can narrow that price gap through tax credits, like those that drive solar and wind-energy projects.</p>\r\n<p>That would require people in the biomass industry to toot their own horns.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do it as well; we&rsquo;re not as proud of it. But we should be. It&rsquo;s renewable; it&rsquo;s base-load power, that&rsquo;s very valuable to utilities,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got diverse outputs and distribution, whether it&rsquo;s electricity or heat or even transportation fuels. We can save money and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and it has a lot of other great ancillary benefits, like supporting forest stewardship and controlled waste disposal.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>There are some federal programs in place that help, such as the U.S. Forest Service&rsquo;s wood energy grants.</p>\r\n<p>But, Kruse predicts there will be less help on the federal side in coming years, so the focus should be on increasing and improving policies within individual states.</p>\r\n<p>Kruse said the best way to encourage state policy is to talk with lawmakers and their staff, and to work with individual communities that are interested in biomass, so they, too, can lobby for state incentive policies.</p>", "original_webfacet": true, "github_link": "", "pushed_to_wp": false, "share_note": "Use as needed", "document_assets": [], "credit": [11], "wf_description": "Ketchikan hosted the annual Alaska Wood Energy Conference last week, where participants heard about how biomass works in different places, and how to make the technology more known, and eventually less expensive to install and operate.", "video_assets": [], "organization": 4}, "model": "editorial.webfacet", "pk": 17}, {"fields": {"code": "", "audio_assets": [], "excerpt": "A seafood processing plant in Unalaska is on the hook for $3.2 million for breaking air pollution regulations.", "creation_date": "2017-04-23T10:29:02.918Z", "owner": 11, "keywords": "[]", "captions": "", "story": 16, "run_date": "2017-04-24T16:00:00Z", "title": "Air pollution violations will cost seafood processing plant $3.2 million", "discussion": 53, "editor": 10, "due_edit": "2017-04-24T15:30:00Z", "image_assets": [14], "status": "In Progress", "wf_content": "<p>A seafood processing plant in Unalaska is on the hook for $3.2 million for breaking air pollution regulations.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement reached Thursday with the Environmental Protection Agency comes eight years after employees at Westward Seafoods turned off air pollution controls and falsified records to cover their tracks.</p>\r\n<p>Westward is required to install a new electronic monitoring system and $1 million will be spent on air pollution reduction.</p>", "original_webfacet": true, "github_link": "", "pushed_to_wp": false, "share_note": "Will be updated", "document_assets": [], "credit": [11], "wf_description": "A seafood processing plant in Unalaska is on the hook for $3.2 million for breaking air pollution regulations.", "video_assets": [], "organization": 4}, "model": "editorial.webfacet", "pk": 18}, {"fields": {"code": "", "audio_assets": [], "excerpt": "The foods we choose to put on our plates \u2014 or toss away \u2013 could have more of an ecological impact than many of us realize.", "creation_date": "2017-04-23T11:07:06.036Z", "owner": 10, "keywords": "[\"Earth Day\", \" climate change\", \" diet\"]", "captions": "", "story": 17, "run_date": "2017-04-24T19:00:00Z", "title": "Chew on this for Earth Day: How our diets impact the planet", "discussion": 55, "editor": 10, "due_edit": "2017-04-24T15:00:00Z", "image_assets": [], "status": "Ready", "wf_content": "<p>The foods we choose to put on our plates &mdash; or toss away &ndash; could have more of an ecological impact than many of us realize.</p>\r\n<p>On Earth Day, here are some ways to consider how our diet impacts the planet.</p>\r\n<p>Waste not, want not</p>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ve heard the numbers on food waste. More than 30 percent of available food is tossed each year in America. It&rsquo;s enough to fill Chicago&rsquo;s 1,450-foot-tall Willis Tower (formerly known as the Sears Tower) 44 times over.</p>\r\n<p>The U.S. has set an official goal to reduce food waste by 50 percent by the year 2030. Universities have begun to chip away at the food waste issue by promoting ugly fruit and vegetables and shifting away from pre-cooked, buffet style food, instead serving more cook-to-order options that can cut down on waste. Food service companies are working with farmers and chefs to get more blemished but edible produce into cafeterias across the country. Even religious groups are getting into the act, raising attention to the problem of food waste among the faithful and connecting with restaurants, retailers and food banks to help redirect food to hungry mouths that might otherwise end up in landfills.</p>\r\n<p>And there are a host of proposed solutions. Check out this report that highlights which solutions are likely to provide most bang for the buck. Among the most cost-effective strategies: educating consumers on food waste &ndash; including changes you can make in your own kitchen. (Here are some tips to get you started &ndash; like how to tell if eggs are still good past their expiration date.)</p>\r\n<p>Rethink your beef and lamb habit</p>\r\n<p>Everything we eat has an environmental footprint &ndash; it takes land, water and energy to grow crops and raise livestock. The folks at the World Resources Institute have calculated the greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing a gram of edible protein of various foods.</p>\r\n<p>Not surprisingly, they found that foods such as beans, fish, nuts and egg have the lowest impact. Poultry, pork, milk and cheese have medium-sized impacts. By far, the biggest impacts, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, were linked to beef, lamb and goat. (As we&rsquo;ve reported, that&rsquo;s partly because the need for pastureland drives deforestation in places like the Brazilian Amazon.)</p>\r\n<p>Why? According to WRI, beef uses 28 times more land per calorie consumed &mdash; and two to four times more freshwater &mdash; than the average of other livestock categories. What&rsquo;s more, cows are less efficient than other animals, like pigs and poultry, at converting feed into food.</p>\r\n<p>Still, telling people to go cold turkey with their red meat isn&rsquo;t likely to inspire real change. But this message might resonate: Even if you don&rsquo;t give up on red meat consumption entirely, just cutting back can significantly impact your diet&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</p>\r\n<p>And these days, there are lots of vegan substitutes &ndash; like plant burgers that sizzle, smell and even bleed like the real thing &mdash; that can deliver the meaty taste you crave as you try to scale back.</p>\r\n<p>Keep an eye out for more &lsquo;plant-based&rsquo; dishes on restaurant menus</p>\r\n<p>As interest in plant-centric diets booms, new food businesses have taken root &ndash; from the veggie-centric fast-casual chains Beefsteak (from celebrity chef Jose Andres) and Chloe (an all-vegan restaurant) to the vegan meal-kit company Purple Carrot.</p>\r\n<p>Now, a new initiative from the World Resources Institute called the Better Buying Lab is bringing together big companies (including Panera Bread, Sodexo, Google, Unilever and Hilton) to develop and test strategies to nudge consumers towards choosing more sustainable foods. One initiative is to get more plant-based dishes onto menus.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you look at menus across the U.S., there tends to be [the same] 25 dishes that are on the majority of menus,&rdquo; says Daniel Vennard, director of the Better Buying Lab at WRI. Think burgers, chicken dishes, etc. &ldquo;Not many [plant-based] dishes have scaled to become national favorites,&rdquo; Vennard says.</p>\r\n<p>His group is working to change that. It&rsquo;s teaming up with chefs from its member companies to create new recipes likely to have broad appeal. Promising ideas include the concept of &ldquo;superfood salads&rdquo; &mdash; containing combinations of nuts, seeds, greens, veggies and avocado.</p>\r\n<p>He points to ideas already out there as well, such as burgers that blend meat and mushrooms. As we reported several years ago, some taste-testing has found that diners warmed up to the idea of blended burgers, and in fact many tasters preferred them to all-beef patties. And an ongoing competition from the James Beard Foundation has encouraged chefs around the country to give blended burgers a try on their menus. (Not everyone is a fan, though.)</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re trying to do is shift consumers towards eating more sustainable food, but we&rsquo;re not advocating for a no-meat diet,&rdquo; explains Vennard. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re saying, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s moderate.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>", "original_webfacet": true, "github_link": "", "pushed_to_wp": false, "share_note": "Use as is.", "document_assets": [], "credit": [19], "wf_description": "Science story on climate change and human diets", "video_assets": [], "organization": 3}, "model": "editorial.webfacet", "pk": 19}, {"fields": {"code": "", "audio_assets": [], "excerpt": "Scientists are pointing to climate change as the reason a river that used to feed into the Yukon has nearly disappeared.", "creation_date": "2017-04-23T11:12:21.800Z", "owner": 10, "keywords": "[\"Nature Geoscience\", \" Kaskawulsh Glacier\", \" Canada\", \" University of Washington\", \" climate change\"]", "captions": "", "story": 18, "run_date": "2017-04-26T13:00:00Z", "title": "In a rare case of river piracy, climate change is the culprit", "discussion": 57, "editor": 10, "due_edit": "2017-04-25T17:00:00Z", "image_assets": [15], "status": "Ready", "wf_content": "<p>Scientists are pointing to climate change as the reason a river that used to feed into the Yukon has nearly disappeared.</p>\r\n<p>A report published in Nature Geoscience on Monday says it&rsquo;s the first documented case of river piracy in modern times &mdash; linked to the planet heating up.

His new mission became figuring out what happened to the Slims River.</p>\r\n<p>The body of water used to flow into the Kluane Lake, and eventually into the Yukon River, which empties into the Bering Sea. But because of glacier melt, that water redirected.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Kaskawulsh River essentially stole all of that water that would have otherwise flowed into the Slims River,&rdquo; Shugar said. &ldquo;So it pirated that flow. It captured that flow.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Now that water goes from the Kaskawulsh River to the Alsek River and all the way to the Gulf of Alaska.</p>\r\n<p>Shugar says, due to the circumstances, this particular situation is unique.

President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s visit was a secret to most &mdash; Governor Bill Walker only found out two weeks in advance. But the governor offered a hearty welcome, with two of his grandchildren waiting on the tarmac with bouquets.</p>\r\n<p>After deplaning, Xi and the Chinese delegation headed South to Beluga Point, to gander at the snow-capped mountains across Turnagain Arm.

Neither leader took any questions.</p>\r\n<p>Before taking off around 11 pm Friday, Xi and his delegation dined with Walker and his staff on king salmon and crab bisque.</p>\r\n<p>At a press conference the next morning, Walker described the meeting as &ldquo;very special&rdquo; &mdash; although the Chinese president may have been disappointed by the restaurant&rsquo;s stationary nature.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When we sat down to have dinner at the Captain Cook we were facing the mountains,&rdquo; said Walker. &ldquo;And he asked if the room would spin&nbsp;&mdash; [would]&nbsp;be turning around.

The length of the requested permit also was shortened to one year.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Miscellaneous Land Use Permits, or MLUPs, can be issued for as little as one year or for as long as five years,&rdquo; Mack said. &ldquo;Based on the amount of interest, and based on the need in our minds to be more proactive and get into the field and be looking at some of the concerns being raised, we issued this permit for one year.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Groups opposed to Pebble say they did not get everything they were hoping for, including a request that the company be required to close any old boreholes no longer in use. But they did cheer the administration for the other changes the state put in place.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is really the state holding Pebble to a tighter standard, which they should,&rdquo; said Kim Williams, the executive director of Nunamta Aulukestai.</p>\r\n<p>Williams, the United Tribes of Bristol Bay and others have voiced concern about a perceived prior lack of state oversight and &ldquo;rubber stamping&rdquo; of permits for the controversial project.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our state hasn&rsquo;t, I believe, held them to a standard of watching them, inspecting them, and making sure that they go back in and close things up,&rdquo; said Williams. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s good for us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>For three summers, Pebble has done little but &ldquo;care and maintenance&rdquo; of their mining claims. Of the more than 1,300 old boreholes, 80 were identified as problematic by the independent inspection paid for by the United Tribes of Bristol Bay.</p>\r\n<p>Pebble also disagrees with the findings of that report, which were a primary theme of the public comments.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Many of the issues that were raised in the public comment window we take great exception to primarily because the technical foundation for it was not very strong,&rdquo; Pebble spokesman Mike Heatwole said Tuesday. &ldquo;We firmly believe that we&rsquo;re in compliance with the terms and conditions for the permit to operate out there.

But the oil and gas company and its allies are still struggling to contain another issue: environmental groups, which argue that Hilcorp&rsquo;s problems in Cook Inlet disqualify the company from drilling for oil in the Arctic Ocean.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier this month, Lois Epstein of the Wilderness Society in Anchorage wrote an op-ed in the Alaska Dispatch News. Epstein&rsquo;s headline read: &ldquo;Hilcorp&rsquo;s Cook Inlet leaks underscore Arctic risks.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I certainly have, and I know others have, enormous concerns about Hilcorp being the operator of this new operation in the Arctic,&rdquo; Epstein said in an interview. &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s a company that doesn&rsquo;t appear to have a strong handle on its operations.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Epstein noted that Hilcorp&rsquo;s gas leak in Cook Inlet took months to fix, as dangerous ice conditions prevented divers from getting to the pipeline. The company also had to shut down two other pipelines in the Inlet this spring due to suspected leaks. Epstein said the incidents raise questions about a project the company is pursuing hundreds of miles to the north.</p>\r\n<p>Hilcorp is moving ahead with the only offshore drilling project currently planned in federal Arctic waters. It&rsquo;s called Liberty. Hilcorp wants to build a gravel island in shallow waters about six miles from the Beaufort Sea coast. According to plans submitted to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the oil would flow to shore via a buried subsea pipeline.</p>\r\n<p>Epstein said&nbsp;that Hilcorp&rsquo;s gas leak in Cook Inlet was hard to fix &mdash; and repairing a pipe or cleaning up an oil spill in Arctic waters would be a lot harder.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You do have lots of other challenges in the Arctic,&rdquo; said Epstein. &ldquo;You have storms, you have certainly cold, you have remoteness, you have the inability to respond very quickly because you don&rsquo;t have the people power and the infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>A growing number of national environmental groups agree with Epstein &mdash; including the Center for Biological Diversity and Greenpeace. They&rsquo;re calling for the federal government to scrutinize Hilcorp&rsquo;s safety record before approving the Liberty Project. And as President Donald Trump weighs an executive order to step back the Obama administration&rsquo;s five-year moratorium on Arctic drilling, some groups argue the gas leak shows oil development in the Arctic shouldn&rsquo;t happen at all.</p>\r\n<p>But the pushback from the oil industry has come hard and fast.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nonsensical; it makes no sense to say, &lsquo;because we had a leak over here means they will never be able to respond to a leak in the Arctic.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s just a fabrication,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Kara Moriarty, who leads the Alaska Oil and Gas Association.</p>\r\n<p>Moriarty wrote her own op-ed in the Alaska Dispatch News. It was just one of a wave of opinion pieces condemning environmental groups&rsquo; arguments, which appeared in both local and national media.</p>\r\n<p>Moriarty argued recent incidents involving Hilcorp don&rsquo;t mean the company can&rsquo;t operate safely in the Arctic.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When something happens, the company responds, they change their behavior, they pay their fine, and they change their process &mdash; that&rsquo;s why you have regulatory oversight,&rdquo; said Moriarty. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not to say, &lsquo;oh, a company did something and we fined them, and and now they shouldn&rsquo;t do anything else in Alaska again.'&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Hilcorp didn&rsquo;t agree to an interview for this story, but in an emailed statement, Hilcorp&rsquo;s Alaska Senior Vice President David Wilkins said the Liberty project is &ldquo;vastly different&rdquo; from its operations in Cook Inlet.

Now, these are cliff-nesting birds,&rdquo; said Kathy Kuletz, a bird researcher with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, referring to one notable example.</p>\r\n<p>Kuletz&rsquo;s research is part of a new report on Arctic marine biodiversity published by the Arctic Council in conjunction with their ministerial meeting in Fairbanks May 10-11. It describes how melting of the Arctic sea ice also is forcing marine species to shift their ranges further north. It also notes that increasing numbers of southern species are moving into Arctic waters, and it describes an increasing frequency in contagious diseases like avian cholera.</p>\r\n<p>In a video version of the report produced by the Arctic Council, Haakon Hop of the Norwegian Polar Institute said the rapid reduction of thicker multi-year and second-year ice is having a dramatic impact on the Arctic sea ice ecosystem.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Things are happening very fast. I don&rsquo;t think most people realize how fast climate warming is affecting Arctic sea ice and the sea ice ecosystem,&rdquo; Hop said. &ldquo;I never thought I would see it in my quite short lifetime as a researcher. But I think I will see an ice-free Arctic Ocean before I&rsquo;m done with my research career.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Reduction in sea ice means changes for beluga whale migration. It also creates problems for harp seals, bearded seals and ringed seals when they have their pups or try to raise them. Walrus will haul out on shore rather than on sea ice, increasing calf mortality from possible stampedes and forcing adults to travel further to find food.</p>\r\n<p>Kit Kovacs of the Norwegian Polar Institute remembers how the sea ice around the Svalbard Archipelago is dramatically different from just 12&nbsp;years ago.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Just suddenly, unpredicted, unprecedented collapse in sea ice,&rdquo; Kovacs said. &ldquo;And, it really hasn&rsquo;t recovered.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The absence of sea ice has affected how scientists observe or survey various species.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing profound changes, many of which are quite difficult to document because the traditional tools available to us like flying surveys at molting to count seals on sea ice are obviously no longer possible without sea ice,&rdquo; Kovacs said.</p>\r\n<p>Kovacs said they&rsquo;re observing behavioral changes. Seals, for example, have to travel further to find food, dive deeper and for a longer period of time, and are resting less.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;All of which means, of course, it costs much more to get the food that you require,&rdquo; Kovacs said. &ldquo;That will eventually have reproductive consequences and growth consequences for these animals. You see that kind of phenomenon in many different species right now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Polar bears usually hunt seals on the sea ice.</p>\r\n<p>But Kathy Kuletz of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said polar bears have been observed foraging for food by going after ground-nesting common eiders or cliff-nesting murres.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When the bears show up, they disturb the birds, the birds fly off,&rdquo; Kuletz said. &ldquo;That not only means that the bears are going after the chicks and eggs that they can get on the cliffs, but when the adult birds leave, because they&rsquo;ve been startled by the bear, the other predators like gulls will come in and attack the eggs and chicks. It&rsquo;s not just what the bears eat, but the disruption in the colony, as well.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Connie Lovejoy of Quebec&rsquo;s Universit&eacute; Laval said they can no longer take data from a particular event and extrapolate to the entire Arctic. For example, higher ocean temperatures may prompt an increase in small, warm water plankton called copepods in one region of the Arctic and an increase of fattier, cold water copepods on the opposite side of the Arctic.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;My big worry is really that by simplifying the system and not having enough data, those nuances, those small differences regionally, they&rsquo;re lost,&rdquo; Lovejoy said. &ldquo;If you want to have local communities able to exploit their resources in the Arctic, they actually need to have a more accurate picture of what the future of their region is going to look like because there is no one Arctic.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>While some countries continuously monitor certain species, other countries may only do research that coincides with specific, short-term projects.</p>\r\n<p>The 200-page report on Arctic marine biodiversity was produced by the Arctic Council&rsquo;s Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna working group.
