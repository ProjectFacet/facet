=============

Project Facet is an open source project to help newsrooms efficiently plan content across all publishing platforms. Facet is an editorial workflow management app that fully covers all aspects of assigning, editing and managing news content.

Facet fosters collaboration across teams and with other organizations by allowing newsrooms to create networks to share the editorial process with teams both in and outside of the media organization.
