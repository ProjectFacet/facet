# Requirements for Facet
#
# PLEASE don't just replace this with the outcome of `pip freeze` -- this should
# list only the things needed by Facet in both development and production mode;
# dev-specific stuff goes in `local.txt` and production-specific stuff in
# `production.txt`. Also, it's very helpful to keep things separated into
# categories, as below.
